# Chapter 27: Truth and Vulnerability

We'd walked most of the way back to town when Jack stopped suddenly, his hand tightening around mine.

"There's something else I need to say," he said. "Before we go back. Before reality sets in."

I turned to face him, worry flickering through me. "Okay."

"You're going to college," he said. "You're going to be surrounded by smart people, educated people. People who've read all the right books and know how to talk about ideas and—" He took a breath. "People who aren't high school dropouts who fix cars for a living."

"We talked about this—"

"No, listen." His voice was urgent. "I need to say this out loud, need you to hear my biggest fear. Because if we're doing this—if we're really trying—you need to know what keeps me up at night."

I nodded, giving him space.

"I'm scared you'll outgrow me," Jack said. "Not just change—I get that everyone changes. I'm scared you'll look back at this summer and see me as...what? A phase? A mistake? The troubled boy you were infatuated with before you knew better?"

"That's not going to happen."

"You don't know that." He wasn't being argumentative, just honest. "You can't know that. You're seventeen, Ruthie. You've lived in Seaside Heights your whole life. College is going to open doors you didn't know existed. You're going to meet people who challenge you intellectually, who share your ambitions, who—"

"Who didn't see me first," I interrupted firmly. "Who don't know what it took for me to choose myself. Who weren't there on that pier when I had to be brave."

"But they'll be there for the next four years. And I'll be here, hundreds of miles away, working on engines while you're writing for newspapers and studying with brilliant professors." Jack's voice cracked slightly. "How do I compete with that?"

"You don't." I took his face in my hands. "You don't compete because this isn't a competition. You're not fighting for space against my education or my dreams or my future classmates. You're already part of my life, Jack. That doesn't disappear just because I go to college."

"Doesn't it? People grow apart."

"People can grow apart," I corrected. "But they can also grow together, just...separately. Jack, I don't want you because you fit some checklist of qualifications. I want you because of who you are."

"A dropout with a motorcycle."

"A person who saw me clearly when no one else did. Who encouraged my dreams even when it meant losing me. Who's brave enough to admit when he's scared." I held his gaze. "That matters more than any degree."

Jack pulled me close, his arms tight around me. "Promise me something."

"What?"

"Promise that if I do become too small for your world—if college changes you and I don't fit anymore—you'll tell me. You won't stay out of pity or obligation or because you feel guilty. Just... tell me the truth."

"I promise," I said against his chest. "But Jack, you need to promise me something too."

"What?"

"Promise you won't sabotage this." I pulled back to look at him. "Promise you won't decide I'm going to leave and run first. Promise you won't interpret every letter that takes too long or every missed phone call as proof that you were right."

He winced. "That's exactly what I'd do."

"I know. That's why you have to promise not to." I was firm about this. "Your fear of abandonment is real. But you can't let it become a self-fulfilling prophecy."

"How do I do that?"

"Trust me." It was simple and impossibly hard. "When I say I love you, believe me. When I write letters, read them without looking for hidden meanings. When I come home for breaks, let yourself be happy instead of waiting for it to end."

Jack was quiet for a long moment. "That might be the hardest thing you've asked me to do."

"Harder than staying?"

"Yeah." He managed a small smile. "Staying is terrifying. But trusting? That's..." He trailed off, then started again. "My whole life, everyone I trusted left. My mom, my dad in a different way. Trusting you means risking that again."

"I know." I took his hands. "I'm asking you to be vulnerable. To let me in completely. To believe that maybe this time could be different."

"And if it's not?"

"Then at least we tried." I squeezed his hands. "At least we were brave enough to be vulnerable. At least we loved honestly instead of protecting ourselves."

Jack pulled me close again, and I felt him trembling slightly. "I don't know if I'm strong enough for this."

"You are." I said it with complete certainty. "You rode back to that pier, didn't you? You listened to my declaration. You admitted your fears. You chose to stay. That's strength, Jack."

"Feels more like terror."

"Love is terrifying," I agreed. "But it's also worth it."

We stood there holding each other, the morning sun climbing higher, the sound of distant traffic reminding us that the world was waking up. Reality was creeping back in—my parents waiting, consequences to face, a future to navigate.

"What about you?" Jack asked suddenly. "What's your biggest fear?"

The question caught me off guard. "About us?"

"About everything. College, leaving, us—all of it. What keeps you up at night?"

I thought about it, really thought about it. "I'm scared I'll disappoint everyone. My parents, you, myself. I'm scared I'll get to San Francisco and realize I'm not as talented as Mr. Henderson thinks. I'm scared I'll be homesick and struggling and wonder if I made a huge mistake."

"But you're going anyway."

"But I'm going anyway," I confirmed. "Because staying would kill something in me, even if leaving is terrifying."

"That's brave."

"So is staying." I smiled at him. "We're both doing the scary thing."

"Together but apart."

"Together but apart," I agreed.

Jack cupped my face gently. "I need you to know something. Whatever happens—whether we make it or we don't—you changed my life, Ruthie. You made me believe I could stay somewhere. That I could be worthy of good things. That running wasn't my only option."

Tears stung my eyes. "You changed mine too. You made me brave. You made me believe my dreams mattered. You showed me what it felt like to be really seen."

"So even if this ends—"

"It will have mattered," I finished. "We'll have mattered."

"Yeah." Jack's smile was tremulous but real. "We'll have mattered."

We kissed then, slow and sweet and honest. Not passionate, but profound. A kiss that acknowledged fear and chose hope anyway. A kiss that said we might not make it but we were trying. A kiss that was both promise and present.

When we pulled apart, Jack rested his forehead against mine. "Okay. I'm in. Completely. Terrified and committed and trying not to sabotage this with my fear."

"And I'm in. Going to college but staying connected. Growing but not growing apart. Writing letters and coming home and building something real even across the distance."

"No promises of forever."

"Just promises of honesty," I agreed.

Jack took a deep breath, like he was steadying himself. "Then let's go face your parents. Together."

"Together," I echoed.

We started walking again, hand in hand, toward town and consequences and the beginning of our actual life together. The declarations were done, the feelings spoken. Now came the hard work of living those promises day by day.

But I wasn't scared anymore. Or rather, I was scared but okay with being scared. Because Jack was right beside me, equally terrified, equally committed.

And somehow, knowing we were both afraid made it easier to be brave.

"Jack?"

"Yeah?"

"Thank you for stopping. For turning around at the pier. For being brave enough to stay."

"Thank you for running after me. For not letting me leave believing I was poison. For—" His voice caught. "For loving me anyway."

"Not anyway," I corrected gently. "Just...completely."

He smiled, real and unguarded. "Completely."

We walked back into Seaside Heights together, ready to face whatever came next. The town that had judged us, the parents who'd tried to control us, the future that stretched uncertain and challenging ahead.

But we'd told the truth. We'd been vulnerable. We'd chosen each other with eyes wide open.

And that felt like victory.

That felt like love.
