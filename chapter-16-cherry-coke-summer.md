# Chapter 16: The Public Proposal

The annual Seaside Heights summer picnic was the social event of the season—the entire town gathered at the beach park for potluck dishes, pie-eating contests, and wholesome small-town fun.

I'd been dreading it all week.

Tommy had called three times asking if I'd come, his voice carefully neutral, like we hadn't fought. I'd made excuses, but when his mother called mine, I found myself with no graceful way out.

"It's just a picnic, Ruthie," my mother said that Saturday morning, laying out my yellow sundress—the one Tommy always said brought out my eyes. "The whole town will be there. It's important we show up as a family."

The unspoken message was clear: and you'll go with Tommy and act like everything's normal.

So I put on the yellow dress and let my mother pin my hair back with the clips she'd bought me for my sixteenth birthday, and I tried not to feel like I was putting on a costume for a play I no longer wanted to perform in.

Jack was working at the garage all day. We'd talked about the picnic, and he'd understood why I had to go, why refusing would cause more problems than it solved. But as I climbed into my father's car, I wished desperately that I could be anywhere else.

The beach park was packed. Red and white checkered blankets spread across the grass, families clustered around picnic tables laden with fried chicken and potato salad and watermelon. The smell of hot dogs on the grill mixed with salt air. Children ran shrieking toward the playground while their mothers gossiped in small circles, sun hats shading their faces.

I spotted Diane immediately, waving from her family's blanket. Tommy was there too, standing near the bandstand with a group of boys from the baseball team. When he saw me, his face lit up with something that looked like hope.

My stomach sank.

"Ruthie!" Tommy jogged over, his smile wide and genuine. "You came. I wasn't sure you would."

"Hi, Tommy." I tried to match his casual tone and failed. "My mom said the whole family was coming, so..."

"Right. Of course." His smile dimmed slightly but held. "Hey, I'm glad you're here. I've been wanting to talk to you. About the other night. I think maybe I came on too strong with the house stuff and—"

"Tommy, maybe now's not the best time—"

"You're right. Later." He squeezed my hand quickly, and I saw my mother watching from across the park, satisfaction on her face. "Come on, Diane's been asking about you."

The afternoon crawled by in a haze of forced normalcy. I helped serve lemonade, watched the pie-eating contest, made small talk with neighbors who asked pointed questions about college plans that I deflected with vague answers. The whole time, I felt Tommy's presence nearby, hovering, hopeful.

Diane pulled me aside near the drink table. "He's going to do something," she hissed, her eyes wide.

"What? Who?"

"Tommy! He's been acting weird all day. Nervous-excited. And his mother keeps crying happy tears every time she looks at you."

My blood ran cold. "No. He wouldn't. Not here."

"Ruthie, I think he's going to propose."

"We broke up," I whispered urgently. "Sort of. We fought. He knows I'm not—"

"Does he though? Because from where I'm standing, you showed up to this picnic looking like his girlfriend, and everyone's treating you like you're still together." Diane's expression was sympathetic but firm. "If you're really done with him, you need to make that clear. Now. Before—"

"Can I have everyone's attention please?" Tommy's voice, amplified by the bandstand microphone, cut across the park.

Every conversation stopped. Every head turned. My heart plummeted into my shoes.

Tommy stood on the small wooden bandstand, microphone in hand, spotlit by the late afternoon sun. His smile was nervous but determined. Dozens of faces turned toward him expectantly, then followed his gaze directly to me.

"I want to talk about my girl, Ruthie Davis," Tommy said, and scattered applause rippled through the crowd.

I couldn't move. Couldn't breathe. My feet felt rooted to the grass.

"Ruthie and I have known each other since we were kids, but we've been dating for two years now. Best two years of my life." Tommy's voice was gaining confidence, warming to his audience. "She's smart and kind and beautiful, and I know—I've always known—that she's the one for me."

My mother was crying. Mrs. Richardson was crying. Diane gripped my arm, her nails digging in.

This couldn't be happening. This wasn't real.

"I know we're young," Tommy continued. "I know some people might say we should wait. But when you know, you know. Right?"

The crowd murmured agreement. Someone shouted, "That's right, Tommy!"

"And I know." Tommy stepped down from the bandstand, still holding the microphone, and started walking toward me. The crowd parted like the Red Sea, creating a clear path between us. "I know Ruthie's the girl I want to spend my life with. The girl I want to build a future with. The girl I want to wake up next to every morning for the rest of my life."

He was getting closer. Twenty feet. Fifteen. Ten.

I looked around desperately for an exit, an escape, anything. But I was surrounded by familiar faces—neighbors, customers from the diner, my parents' friends, Tommy's parents, my own parents. All of them smiling, expectant, delighted.

All of them waiting for the fairy tale ending.

Tommy reached me and lowered the microphone. In the sudden quiet, I could hear my own heartbeat pounding in my ears, the distant crash of waves, a child laughing somewhere far away.

Then Tommy got down on one knee.

The crowd gasped collectively—a sound of pure delight. Someone started clapping. Others joined in. The applause swelled around us like a wave I couldn't escape.

Tommy pulled a small velvet box from his pocket, and I thought I might actually faint.

"Ruthie Davis," Tommy said, his voice carrying clearly without the microphone now, "you're the best thing that ever happened to me. You make me better. You make me happy. You make me want to be the kind of man who deserves you."

The ring box opened. Inside, a small diamond caught the sunlight, winking at me like an accusation.

"Will you marry me?"

The world narrowed to a pinpoint. Tommy's hopeful face. The ring. The watching crowd. My mother's tears. The weight of every expectation I'd carried my entire life pressing down on my chest like a physical force.

This was the moment I was supposed to say yes. The moment every girl in Seaside Heights dreamed of—a public proposal from the nice boy with the good job and the secure future. The happy ending everyone wanted for me.

But I couldn't breathe. The dress felt too tight. The sun was too bright. There were too many people watching, too many expectations crushing me, too much future being decided without anyone asking what I actually wanted.

"Ruthie?" Tommy's smile was starting to falter. "Baby, it's okay. I know it's a surprise."

"I..." The word came out strangled.

Say yes, my mother's expression commanded from across the circle of watchers.

Say yes, the crowd's eager faces seemed to plead.

Say yes, the whole weight of Seaside Heights and small-town expectations and the safe life everyone wanted for me demanded.

But I looked at Tommy's face—earnest, hopeful, so certain this was right—and I saw the rest of my life mapped out in that moment. The house on Maple Street with the white shutters. Working at the diner until my feet ached and my dreams died. Watching other people leave town while I stayed, shrinking a little more each year until I disappeared entirely into the role of Mrs. Tommy Richardson.

I saw myself at thirty, at forty, at fifty—always wondering what might have been if I'd been brave enough to say what I really wanted.

"I'm sorry," I whispered.

Tommy's smile froze. "What?"

"I'm sorry," I said louder, my voice breaking. "I can't."

The crowd's murmur shifted from delight to confusion. My mother made a small wounded sound.

"Ruthie, I know it's sudden, but—"

"No." I stepped back, my voice finding strength even as tears blurred my vision. "No, Tommy. I can't marry you. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."

I saw the exact moment my words registered. Saw hope crumble into confusion, confusion sharpen into hurt, hurt harden into humiliation. Tommy was still kneeling, still holding the ring box open, but his face had gone white.

"You're—you're saying no?" His voice was barely audible. "In front of everyone, you're saying no?"

"I'm sorry," I said again, because it was all I could say, all I had to offer. "I'm so sorry."

Then I ran.

I hiked up my yellow sundress and ran through the park, past the bandstand, past the picnic blankets and the shocked faces and my mother calling my name. I ran past the playground and down the path toward the beach, my white sandals kicking up dust, tears streaming down my face.

I didn't stop until I reached the pier.

My pier. Mine and Jack's. The one place in Seaside Heights that felt like sanctuary.

I collapsed onto the weathered wood, gasping for air, my whole body shaking with sobs. Behind me, I could hear the confused buzz of the picnic resuming, murmurs spreading like wildfire. I'd just humiliated Tommy in front of the entire town. Broken his heart publicly. Become the girl who said no to the golden boy.

There was no taking it back. No walking away from this unscathed.

But even as guilt and horror washed over me in waves, even as I imagined my mother's disappointed face and Tommy's devastation and the town's judgment—underneath it all was something else.

Relief.

Terrible, shameful, overwhelming relief.

I'd said no. I'd chosen myself. I'd stood in front of everyone and refused the safe, expected path.

And even though everything was about to get so much worse, even though I'd just destroyed any hope of easy forgiveness or simple peace—I'd told the truth.

I'd finally told the truth.

I sat on the pier watching the sun sink lower, my yellow dress dirty and tear-stained, my carefully pinned hair falling loose around my face. In the distance, I could still hear music from the picnic, laughter carrying on the breeze like everything was normal.

But nothing was normal. Nothing would ever be normal again.

I'd just burned down my old life in front of an audience.

Now I had to figure out how to build a new one from the ashes.
