# Chapter 21: Jack's Decision to Leave

Jack didn't come to the diner on Sunday.

Two-thirty came and went without the rumble of his motorcycle. By three o'clock, I was watching the door desperately.

"He's not coming," Rita said, not unkindly.

"He might—"

"Honey, if he was coming, he'd be here. Men get spooked. Especially ones not used to staying."

Monday was the same. No Jack. Tuesday brought nothing but his absence. I considered going to the garage, but my parents were watching me like hawks.

Wednesday afternoon, Diane cornered me during my break, her expression troubled.

"Ruthie, I need to tell you something," she said, glancing around to make sure we were alone in the back room. "And you're not going to like it."

My heart stopped. "What?"

"Mrs. Murphy was in for lunch. She mentioned Jack gave notice at the garage." Diane's voice was gentle, sympathetic. "She said he's leaving Seaside Heights."

The world tilted. "No. That's not— he wouldn't—"

"I'm sorry. I thought you should know before..." She trailed off, letting the implications hang.

Before he left without saying goodbye.

I made it through the rest of my shift by sheer force of will, mechanically taking orders and delivering plates while my mind raced. Jack was leaving. After everything we'd said, after all his promises to stay and try, he was running.

Just like he always did.

That evening, I waited until my parents were absorbed in their television program, then slipped out. I walked to Murphy's Garage, heart pounding.

A light was on in the apartment above. I climbed the rickety external stairs, each step creaking.

I knocked. No answer.

"Jack?" I called. "I know you're in there. Please."

Silence. Then footsteps. The door opened a crack, and Jack stood there, backlit by the bare bulb of his room. He looked exhausted, shadows under his eyes, his hair disheveled.

"Ruthie." His voice was flat. "You shouldn't be here."

"I heard you gave notice. I heard you're leaving."

He didn't deny it. Just stood there, one hand on the door like he was debating whether to let me in or shut me out.

"Can I come in? Please?"

He stepped back. I slipped inside.

The room was sparse—single bed, hotplate, small dresser. And his duffel bag, half-packed.

My chest constricted.

"It's true," I said. "You're really leaving."

"Yeah." Jack closed the door but didn't move closer. "I am."

"When?"

"Tomorrow morning. Early."

"And you weren't going to tell me?" My voice cracked. "You were just going to disappear?"

"It's better this way." He wouldn't meet my eyes. "Clean break. No long goodbyes."

"Better for who?" Anger flared through the hurt. "For you? Because running away is what you do when things get hard?"

"This isn't about running—"

"Then what is it about?" I stepped closer, forcing him to look at me. "Explain it to me, Jack. Because a week ago you promised you'd stay. You said we'd try. And now you're packing your bag like none of that mattered."

Jack's jaw clenched. "I've been thinking about everything that's happened. Everything you've lost because of me."

"Because of me," I corrected. "Because of my choices."

"Choices I influenced. Choices you made because I was here, encouraging you, making you question everything." He ran a hand through his hair, agitated. "Ruthie, look at what's happened since I rode into town. You broke up with Tommy—publicly humiliated him. Your whole town turned against you. Your parents are so angry they've grounded you like a child. Your reputation is ruined. And it's all connected to me."

"It's all connected to me finally being honest about what I want—"

"And what has that honesty gotten you? You're trapped in your house, sneaking out windows to see me, fighting with everyone you love. How is that better than the life you had before?"

"Because it's honest!" I was almost shouting now. "Because I'm not pretending anymore. Yes, it's hard and messy and painful, but at least it's real."

"And what happens next?" Jack's voice rose. "You keep fighting until they throw you out? Sacrifice your family for a boy you've known two months? That's not fair."

"You don't get to decide what's fair to me."

"Someone needs to." Jack grabbed a shirt, stuffed it in his duffel. "You're seventeen with your whole life ahead. And I'm a dropout with no prospects. What do I offer except problems?"

"You offered me yourself," I said quietly. "You saw me when no one else did. You encouraged my dreams when everyone else told me to be practical. You made me feel like I could be more than what everyone expected."

"And look where that got you." Jack's voice was bitter. "Grounded. Fighting with your family. Sneaking around like a criminal. I'm poison, Ruthie. Everything I touch turns to shit. It's what I'm good at."

"That's not true—"

"It is true!" He spun to face me, and I saw real anguish in his eyes. "My mother left because of me. My father drank because of me. Everyone who gets close to me ends up worse off. And now you—sweet, smart, talented you—you're throwing away your future because I showed up and made you think you could have something different."

"You didn't make me think anything," I said fiercely. "I already thought it. I already felt trapped. I already wanted more. You just helped me be brave enough to say it out loud."

"Then I did the damage already." Jack's voice dropped. "And the kindest thing I can do now is leave. Let you fix things with your parents. Let the town forget about the drifter who caused trouble. Let you go to college without me complicating things."

"That's not kind. That's cowardly."

"Maybe." He didn't argue. "But it's also the right thing."

"The right thing would be staying and fighting for us."

"There is no us, Ruthie." The words hit like a slap. "There's you with a bright future ahead, and there's me—the guy who's been running from town to town because he doesn't know how to stay. I can't be what you need. I can't be the person who makes your life better instead of worse. The best thing I can do for you is get out of your way."

Tears were streaming down my face now. "You don't mean that."

"I do." But his voice was rough, unsteady. "I care about you too much to keep hurting you. And staying here, being in your life—that's just going to cause more damage."

"So you're just going to leave? Just like that?"

"Just like that." He picked up his duffel bag, slung it over his shoulder. "I'm sorry, Ruthie. For all of it. For encouraging you to want more, for making you think we could have something real. I was selfish and stupid, and you paid the price."

"You weren't selfish. You were honest."

"Honest would've been leaving the first time I felt myself caring. Before I messed up your life." Jack moved toward the door, and panic surged through me.

"Don't do this." I grabbed his arm. "Please, Jack. Don't run."

"I'm not running." But we both knew he was. "I'm letting you go. There's a difference."

"Is there?" My voice broke completely. "Because from where I'm standing, it looks the same. It looks like you're doing exactly what your mother did—leaving without giving the people who care about you a choice."

Jack flinched like I'd hit him. For a moment, I thought I'd gotten through. But then his expression hardened again, walls slamming back into place.

"Maybe I am," he said. "Maybe it's genetic. Maybe I'm exactly like her—incapable of staying, incapable of being what people need. But at least this way, you know up front. You don't waste years hoping I'll change."

He opened the door, gestured for me to leave. "Go home, Ruthie. Forget about me. Apply to your colleges, make up with your parents, build the life you're supposed to have. You'll thank me eventually."

"I won't," I said, but I walked toward the door because what else could I do? "I won't thank you for this, Jack. For taking the choice away from me. For deciding you know better than I do what I need."

"Maybe not." He was still holding the door, waiting. "But you'll understand someday. When you're in college, writing for some newspaper, living the life you dreamed about—you'll understand why I had to leave."

I stopped in the doorway, looked up at him one last time. "When are you going?"

"Sunrise. Before anyone's awake."

"So this is goodbye."

"Yeah." His voice was barely audible. "This is goodbye."

He leaned down, kissed my forehead—gentle, final. Then he stepped back, putting distance between us.

"Go home," he said again. "Don't come back here. Don't try to find me in the morning. Just... let me go."

I wanted to argue more, to beg, to make him see reason. But pride kept my mouth shut. If he wanted to run, I couldn't stop him. I couldn't force him to be brave when his fear was bigger than his love.

So I walked away. Down the rickety stairs, across the empty parking lot, into the darkening evening. I didn't look back, even though I wanted to. Even though every step felt like tearing something essential out of my chest.

By the time I reached my street, I was crying so hard I could barely see. I climbed the oak tree, crawled through my window, collapsed on my bed.

Jack was leaving. At sunrise, he'd ride out of my life, and I couldn't stop him.

Everyone had been right. My parents, Diane, Tommy, the town gossips—they'd all warned me this would happen. That Jack was trouble, that he'd break my heart, that I'd be left with nothing.

And here I was, exactly where they'd predicted. Alone, heartbroken, with my life in shambles.

The worst part was I still couldn't regret it. Even now, even with my heart breaking, I couldn't regret knowing him. Couldn't regret those conversations on the pier, those motorcycle rides up the coast, those moments when I felt truly seen for the first time in my life.

Jack had broken my heart. But he'd also cracked it open, let light in, showed me I could be more than the good girl everyone expected.

Even if it hurt like hell to lose him.

I curled up on my bed, clutching my journal, and let myself fall apart. Tomorrow I'd figure out how to put myself back together. Tomorrow I'd face my parents, my life, my future without him.

But tonight, I just let myself grieve the boy who'd seen me clearly and then walked away.

The boy who was too afraid to stay.

The boy who was leaving at sunrise.
