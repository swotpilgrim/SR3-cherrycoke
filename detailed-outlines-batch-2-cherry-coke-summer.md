        Diane says she's worried for Ruthie's reputation. In their small town, being seen with the "wrong boy" makes her the "wrong girl."

        Ruthie defends Jack's character. Diane argues that in 1957 Seaside Heights, appearance is reality; what people think is what matters.

        Diane asks hard questions about their future, her parents, and Tommy, saying Ruthie is choosing uncertainty over security.

        Jack describes coming home at age twelve to find his mother's closet empty. No note. His father, drunk, just said she was gone for good.

        He describes checking the mailbox for years, wondering if it was his fault, while also caring for his alcoholic father, ashamed and isolated.

        He admits he learned loneliness and that people always leave. He moves on so he can't be abandoned.
