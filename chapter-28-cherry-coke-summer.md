# Chapter 28: The Sunrise Kiss

Before we reached town, before we had to face my parents and reality and consequences, Jack stopped one more time at the edge of the boardwalk.

"Wait," he said, tugging me gently back toward the beach.

"We're already so late," I protested, but I was smiling.

"I know. Just—one more minute. Please."

We walked back out onto the sand, to the quiet space between ocean and town where we'd had our first real conversations, our first honest moments. The sun had fully risen now, painting everything in golden light.

"I want to remember this," Jack said, looking out at the water. "This moment. Before everything gets complicated again."

"It's already complicated."

"More complicated, then." He turned to me, and the expression on his face made my breath catch. "But right now, right here—it's just us. And I want to remember what that feels like."

I understood. Soon we'd face my parents' anger, the town's judgment, the logistics of his staying and my leaving. We'd have to navigate the messy reality of our choices. But right now, we had this—the beach, the morning, the truth between us.

"You're beautiful," Jack said suddenly.

I laughed, self-conscious, reaching up to touch my windblown hair. "I'm a mess. I've been crying, I haven't brushed my hair, I'm wearing yesterday's clothes—"

"Not that kind of beautiful." He stepped closer, his expression so earnest it made my chest ache. "The kind that comes from being exactly who you are. From being brave enough to run six blocks to find me. From being honest enough to tell me the truth even when it hurt."

My throat tightened. "Jack—"

"I've never met anyone like you," he continued, his voice rough with emotion. "You're seventeen and you're braver than anyone I've ever known. You stood on that bandstand and chose yourself in front of the whole town. You climbed out windows and chased down scared boys on motorcycles. You refuse to be small just because it would be easier."

"You taught me that," I whispered.

"No." He touched my face gently, his calloused fingers tender against my cheek. "That was always in you. I just got to witness it. And watching you become yourself—watching you find your courage and claim your voice—that's been the most incredible thing I've ever seen."

"Stop," I said, but I was smiling through fresh tears. "You're going to make me cry again."

"I want you to know," he said seriously. "Before we go back to town, before everything gets complicated again—I want you to know that you changed my life. Not just by loving me, but by showing me what real courage looks like. You made me want to be brave too."

The morning breeze lifted my hair, and I thought about how much had changed in just a few hours. Last night I'd thought I'd lost him. This morning I'd run desperate through empty streets. And now—now we stood here having chosen each other despite every reason not to.

"I want to kiss you," Jack said quietly. "But I need you to know—it's not just because you're pretty or because I'm caught up in the moment. I want to kiss you because watching you become yourself has been the most incredible thing I've ever witnessed. Because your courage makes me want to be brave too. Because—"

I kissed him before he could finish, rising up on my toes to meet him. His words had been perfect, but I needed action more than speech. I needed to feel this was real.

The kiss started gentle—tentative, as if we were still afraid this might disappear. His lips were soft against mine, questioning. But then Jack's arms came around me, solid and sure, pulling me closer, and I wrapped my hands in his hair, and gentle transformed into something deeper. Something honest.

This wasn't like the careful kisses with Tommy, where I'd always held something back, always performed being in love rather than feeling it. This was completely different. This was honest and open and slightly desperate—two people who'd almost lost each other, grateful for second chances. There was no performance here, no trying to be what someone expected. Just truth.

I felt the warmth of the sun on my closed eyelids. Smelled the salt air and motor oil and something distinctly Jack. Heard the waves rolling in below us and the cry of gulls overhead. But mostly I felt him—his heartbeat against my chest, his hands gentle in my hair, his breath mixing with mine.

When we finally pulled apart, both breathless, Jack rested his forehead against mine. His eyes were still closed, like he was trying to memorize the moment.

"That was—"

"Yeah," I agreed, not needing him to finish. My lips were tingling, my heart racing. I felt dizzy and grounded all at once.

"I've been wanting to do that for weeks," he admitted quietly.

"Me too." The confession felt important. "Since that night at the overlook when you told me about your mother. Maybe even before that."

We stood there, foreheads touching, breathing the same air, the rest of the world fading to background noise. The ocean rolled beneath the morning sky. Seagulls called overhead. Somewhere in town, church bells chimed the hour.

"I love you," Jack said again, like he needed to keep saying it to make it real.

"I love you too."

He kissed me again, softer this time. Then my temple, my cheek, the corner of my mouth—small kisses like punctuation marks, emphasizing the moment.

"We should probably go," I said reluctantly. "Before my parents call the police."

"Probably." But neither of us moved.

"Jack?"

"Yeah?"

"Promise me something."

"Anything."

"Promise we'll come back here. To this beach. When I'm home for Thanksgiving, or Christmas, or summer break—promise we'll come back to where we almost lost each other and remember why we chose to stay."

Jack pulled back to look at me, his expression serious. "I promise. Every time you come home, we'll come here first. Before the diner, before your parents, before anything else—we come here. To remember."

"To remember we were brave," I added.

"To remember we chose each other," he said.

"To remember it was worth it." I squeezed his hands. "Even when it's hard."

"Especially when it's hard." He kissed my forehead, gentle and sure. "This beach—this is ours. Where we almost lost each other. Where we decided to try anyway."

"Our place," I said softly, liking the sound of it.

"Our place," he agreed.

I took his hand, laced our fingers together, and looked back at the beach one more time. The sun was bright now, the morning fully arrived. This moment—this golden bubble of just us—was ending. Reality waited.

"Okay. Now I'm ready to face reality."

"You sure?"

"No." I smiled at him, feeling nervous and brave and terrified and excited all at once. "But I'm doing it anyway."

We walked back across the sand, up to the boardwalk, toward town. With each step, the golden bubble of our beach moment dissolved, replaced by the awareness of what waited: my furious parents, missed shifts at the diner, consequences for sneaking out, the town's continued judgment.

But Jack's hand was warm and solid in mine. And that made everything else seem manageable.

"What will you say to them?" Jack asked as we neared Main Street. His voice was quiet, concerned. "Your parents, I mean. When we walk in there."

"The truth." It was the only option now, the only path forward. "That I love you. That you're staying in Seaside Heights. That I'm still applying to colleges—San Francisco State, maybe UCLA. That I'm sorry for worrying them but I'm not sorry for my choices."

"They might not accept that," he said carefully. "Your mother was pretty clear about what she thinks of me."

"I know." I squeezed his hand, feeling the calluses from his work at the garage. "But I can't live my life trying to earn acceptance by being someone I'm not. Not anymore. I'd rather have their anger and my honesty than their approval and my silence."

Jack stopped walking, turned to face me. "Are you sure about this? About me? Because once you walk in there with me, once you claim this in front of everyone—there's no taking it back."

"I don't want to take it back," I said firmly. "I want to claim it. I want them to know I chose you. I want the whole town to know."

"Even if it makes everything harder?"

"Especially then." I touched his face, feeling the stubble on his jaw. "You told me that choosing myself is braver than choosing safety. Well, I'm choosing myself. And part of myself is loving you."

"When did you get so wise?" he asked, but he was smiling.

"Since I met a boy who taught me that choosing yourself is braver than choosing safety."

"I think you taught me that," he said.

"Then we taught each other." I kissed him quickly. "Come on. Let's go be brave together."

We reached the corner of Main Street, where we'd have to decide—did Jack come with me to face my parents? Or did we part here, face our separate consequences alone?

"Come with me," I said, deciding. "To the diner. Let me introduce you properly. Let me claim you in front of everyone."

Jack's eyes widened. "Are you sure? That's going to make things harder with your parents."

"Everything's already hard." I pulled him forward. "Might as well be hard and honest."

"Okay." He took a deep breath. "Together, then."

"Together."

We walked down Main Street hand in hand, passing early morning churchgoers and shop owners opening for business. People stared. People whispered. I felt their judgment like a physical weight.

But I also felt Jack beside me, steady and real. I felt the truth of our choices. I felt brave.

The diner came into view, its familiar red and chrome exterior both welcoming and daunting. Through the plate-glass window, I could see my mother at the counter, my father in the kitchen. The Sunday breakfast crowd filling the booths.

"Ready?" Jack asked.

"No." I smiled at him. "But I'm doing it anyway."

He kissed me one more time—quick and sure and in full view of anyone who might be watching. A statement. A choice.

"For luck," he said.

"For courage," I corrected.

Then, hand in hand, we walked toward the diner. Toward my parents and reality and the messy, complicated future we'd chosen.

But we'd kissed on that beach with the sunrise behind us. We'd told each other the truth. We'd been brave enough to be vulnerable.

And whatever happened next, we'd face it together.

That was enough.

That was everything.
