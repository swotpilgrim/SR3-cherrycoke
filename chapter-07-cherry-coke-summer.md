# Chapter 7: The Midnight Ride Offer

Thursday nights I close the diner. It's the shift no one else wants—sweeping floors, wiping down every surface, restocking for Friday's breakfast rush, locking up at ten PM and walking home alone through the quiet streets. But I like it. It's the only time I get to be alone with my thoughts, the only time the diner belongs to just me.

Tonight, though, my thoughts are spinning.

The argument with Mom at dinner still stings. She found the East of Eden book in my room—Jack's book—and wanted to know where I got it. I tried to play it off as something Mr. Henderson lent me, but Mom's no fool.

"Mr. Henderson doesn't read novels, Ruthie. He reads newspapers."

The lie fell apart in my hands. I admitted a customer gave it to me. Mom's face went tight and disappointed, and she launched into another lecture about appropriate boundaries and good girls and the future I'm jeopardizing.

"Your college dreams are a waste of time anyway," she said finally, exasperated. "We need you here. The diner needs you. Tommy needs you. When are you going to accept that and stop fighting reality?"

I didn't have an answer. I just went to work.

Now it's 9:55, and I'm wiping down the last booth while the jukebox plays softly in the corner—someone's quarter from earlier, the same Buddy Holly song on repeat. The diner is dim except for the lights over the counter, and outside the plate-glass windows, Seaside Heights is dark and quiet.

I should feel peaceful. Instead, I feel like I'm suffocating.

I finish the booth, hang up my apron, grab my purse. The clock over the counter shows 10:02. I turn off the lights, lock the door behind me, and step into the parking lot.

And freeze.

Jack is there, leaning against his motorcycle under the single streetlight, his leather jacket catching the yellow glow. He straightens when he sees me, hands in his pockets, expression unreadable.

My heart does a complicated flip in my chest.

"What are you doing here?" The words come out more breathless than I intend.

"Waiting for you."

"It's ten o'clock at night."

"I know." He takes a step closer, still keeping a respectful distance. "I know your Thursday shift ends at ten. I know you walk home alone. And I know—" He pauses. "I know you've had a rough day."

"How could you possibly know that?"

"You get this look when you're stressed. You bite your bottom lip and your shoulders go up around your ears." He demonstrates, and despite everything, I almost smile. "You had that look when I came in for coffee this afternoon."

The fact that he notices these things about me—that he pays enough attention to read my moods—makes something warm unfurl in my chest.

"My mom found your book," I admit. "She wasn't happy about it."

Jack's jaw tightens. "I didn't mean to get you in trouble."

"It's not your fault. Everything gets me in trouble lately. Wanting to go to college, not wanting to marry Tommy, talking to you." I hitch my purse higher on my shoulder. "According to everyone in my life, I'm making terrible choices."

"Are you?"

The question hangs in the night air.

"I don't know anymore. Maybe they're right. Maybe I'm being selfish and ungrateful and stupid."

Jack is quiet for a long moment. Then: "Want to go for a ride?"

My breath catches. "What?"

"A ride. On the motorcycle. Up the coast highway." He nods toward the bike. "I'll have you home by midnight. Scout's honor."

"Were you a scout?"

"No. But the offer still stands."

I should say no. It's late, my parents would be furious, and this is exactly the kind of thing Rita and my mother warned me about. Boys like Jack, motorcycles, late nights—nothing good comes from that combination.

But I'm so tired of being good. So tired of doing what everyone expects while my dreams get dismissed as a waste of time.

"I've never been on a motorcycle before," I say.

"I know. That's why I'm asking." He watches me carefully. "But if you say no, I'll leave. No hard feelings. No pressure. Just thought you might want to see something beautiful instead of going home to another lecture about appropriate boundaries."

How does he know exactly what I need?

"Why?" I ask. "Why are you doing this? You don't even know me."

"I know enough." He pulls his spare helmet from where it hangs on the motorcycle. "I know you're smart and kind and you dream about journalism but everyone tells you it's impractical. I know you write in a journal about people who feel trapped. I know you work hard and smile even when you're exhausted and you see people clearly—really see them, not just whatever surface they show."

My throat tights. No one has ever described me like that. Like I'm more than just a role I play.

"I know you bite your lip when you're stressed," he continues, softer now. "And you have kind eyes. And you're braver than you think you are. Is that enough?"

The question isn't really about knowing me. It's about trust.

Do I trust him? This boy I've known for barely two weeks? This stranger with a motorcycle and a mysterious past and shadows in his eyes?

I think about going home. About climbing into bed and writing in my journal and waking up tomorrow to the same routine, the same expectations, the same slow suffocation.

I think about my mother's words: Your college dreams are a waste of time.

I think about Tommy's assumption that I'll marry him because that's just what happens next.

I think about Rita saying everyone has dreams when they're young, but then we grow up and accept reality.

And I think about Jack's book and the word timshel. Thou mayest. You have a choice.

"Midnight?" I say. "You promise?"

Something like relief crosses Jack's face. "Midnight. I promise."

He hands me the helmet, and I take it with shaking hands. It's heavier than I expected, solid and real.

"How do I—?"

"Here." Jack steps closer, so close I can smell the leather of his jacket and something underneath—soap and summer night. He helps me position the helmet, his fingers careful as he adjusts the strap under my chin. "Too tight?"

I shake my head, not trusting my voice.

"Okay. So you'll sit behind me, put your feet on these pegs." He indicates the metal footrests. "And you'll need to hold on."

"To what?"

"To me." His eyes meet mine through the helmet visor. "You can hold onto my waist or my shoulders. Whatever feels comfortable. And lean with me on turns—don't fight the motion. Trust the bike. Trust me."

Trust me.

Two words that could mean everything or nothing.

Jack swings onto the motorcycle with practiced ease, and it dips slightly under his weight. He looks back at me, waiting.

This is it. The moment of choice. I can say no, go home, be the good girl everyone wants me to be. Or I can climb onto this motorcycle with a boy I barely know and see what it feels like to choose something for myself.

*Timshel.*

I step forward and awkwardly climb onto the seat behind him. The motorcycle is warm from the day's sun, and I'm suddenly very aware of how close Jack and I are—my thighs against his, my chest nearly pressed to his back.

"You good?" he asks over his shoulder.

"I think so."

"Arms around my waist. Hold on tight."

I wrap my arms around him, and even through the leather jacket I can feel the solid warmth of him, the lean muscle, the steady rise and fall of his breathing. My heart is pounding so hard I'm sure he can feel it.

Jack kicks the engine to life, and the motorcycle roars awake beneath us. The vibration runs through my entire body, terrifying and thrilling.

"Ready?" he calls back.

No. Yes. I don't know.

"Ready," I say.

And just like that, we're moving. Slowly at first, pulling out of the parking lot, then faster as we hit the main road. The wind whips past, and I tighten my grip on Jack's waist, convinced I'm going to fall off.

But I don't fall. The motorcycle is steady beneath us, and Jack drives like he's part of the machine—smooth, confident, completely in control.

We leave Seaside Heights behind, heading north up the coast highway. The ocean is a dark presence to our left, the cliffs rising to our right. Above us, stars scatter across the sky like someone spilled diamonds.

I've lived near this ocean my whole life, but I've never seen it like this. Never felt the wind in my face and the rumble of an engine and the absolute freedom of movement, of going somewhere, of choosing a direction and just going.

Jack opens up the throttle, and we fly down the dark highway. I should be terrified. Instead, I feel alive in a way I never have before.

After twenty minutes, Jack slows and pulls off at a scenic overlook I've driven past a hundred times but never stopped at. He kills the engine, and the sudden silence is almost shocking.

We sit for a moment, my arms still around his waist, both of us breathing hard.

"You okay?" he asks.

I release my grip and climb off the bike, my legs shaky. When I pull off the helmet, I'm grinning so wide my face hurts.

"That was—" I can't find the words. "That was amazing."

Jack smiles, a real smile that transforms his entire face. "Yeah?"

"Yeah." I look around at the overlook, the view of the ocean stretching to the horizon, the lights of small towns dotting the coast. "How did you find this place?"

"I've been riding the highway at night. Mapping out all the good spots." He dismounts and leans against the wooden railing. "Figured you might like to see it."

I join him at the railing, and for a while, we just stand there in comfortable silence, looking at the ocean under the stars.

"You said you write about people who feel trapped," Jack says eventually. "What would you write about this?"

"About this? Right now?"

"Yeah. If you were documenting this moment, what would you say?"

I think about it, trying to put the feeling into words.

"I'd write about how you can live somewhere your whole life and never really see it. About how I've been looking at this ocean from the beach and the boardwalk and the diner, but I've never seen it from up here. From this angle, it looks different. Bigger. Like there's more of it than I thought."

Jack nods slowly. "That's good. That's really good."

"And I'd write about—" I hesitate. "About how sometimes you need someone to show you a different view before you realize you've been looking at things wrong."

"Is that what this is? A different view?"

"Maybe. I don't know yet." I lean on the railing, letting the wind blow through my hair. "My whole life, everyone's been telling me what to want. Stay in Seaside Heights. Take over the diner. Marry Tommy. Be grateful for what I have. But Jack—what if what I have isn't what I want?"

"Then you choose something different."

"It's not that simple."

"Isn't it?" He turns to look at me directly. "Ruthie, you're seventeen. You're not locked into anything yet. You can apply to college. You can pursue journalism. You can figure out what you actually want instead of just accepting what other people want for you."

"And what about my parents? Tommy? Everyone who's counting on me?"

"What about you? Who's counting on you to count on yourself?"

The question hits like a punch to the chest.

We stand there as the waves crash below and the stars wheel overhead, and I feel something shifting inside me. A recognition that maybe, just maybe, I don't have to live the life everyone else has planned.

"I've never met anyone like you," I say quietly. "You're so sure. So certain that you can just choose and go."

"That's because I've spent the last year doing exactly that. Choosing and going." His voice goes rough. "It's not always better, Ruthie. Sometimes choosing means losing everything familiar. Sometimes it means being alone."

"You're alone now?"

"Yeah. But I'm also free." He looks at me. "That's the trade-off. Freedom costs security. You have to decide which one matters more."

I want to ask him which one he chose, but I think I already know. Jack chose freedom, and it brought him here, to Seaside Heights, to the diner, to me.

"Thank you," I say. "For this. For showing me."

"We should head back. Don't want to break my midnight promise."

The ride back is different. I'm not scared anymore, just exhilarated. I hold onto Jack and lean into the turns and feel the wind and the speed and the absolute thrill of movement.

He drops me off two houses from mine at 11:58 PM, exactly as promised.

When I hand back the helmet, our fingers brush, and the contact sends sparks up my arm.

"Same time next week?" he asks. "If you want."

I should say no. I should end this before it becomes something I can't control.

But I'm still flying from the ride, still feeling the wind in my hair and the possibility in my chest.

"Yes," I say. "Same time next week."

Jack's smile is worth every risk.

I watch him ride away, then slip into my house as quietly as possible. The lights are off—my parents already in bed—and I creep to my room without waking them.

Only when I'm safely behind my closed door do I let out the breath I've been holding.

I've just been on a midnight motorcycle ride with Jack Malone.

I've just chosen something for myself, consequences be damned.

And it felt like the most honest thing I've ever done.
