# Chapter 7: The Midnight Ride Offer

Thursday nights I close the diner—sweeping, wiping, restocking, locking up at ten. Tonight my thoughts are spinning from the argument with Mom at dinner. She found Jack's book in my room and wanted to know where I got it.

The lie fell apart quickly. Mom's face went tight as she launched into another lecture about boundaries and good girls.

"Your college dreams are a waste of time anyway," she said finally. "We need you here. When are you going to accept reality?"

I didn't have an answer. I just went to work.

Now it's 9:55, and I'm wiping down the last booth while the jukebox plays softly in the corner—someone's quarter from earlier, the same Buddy Holly song on repeat. The diner is dim except for the lights over the counter, and outside the plate-glass windows, Seaside Heights is dark and quiet.

I should feel peaceful after finishing the shift. Instead, I feel like I'm suffocating under the weight of Mom's words. *A waste of time.* As if everything I dream about, everything I want, doesn't matter.

I finish the booth, hang up my apron in the back room, grab my purse from under the counter. The clock shows 10:02. I turn off the lights one by one, lock the door behind me with the familiar key, and step into the empty parking lot.

And freeze.

Jack is there, leaning against his motorcycle under the single streetlight, his leather jacket catching the yellow glow. He straightens when he sees me, hands in his pockets, expression unreadable.

My heart does a complicated flip in my chest.

"What are you doing here?"

"Waiting for you. I know you've had a rough day."

"How—?"

"You get this look when you're stressed. You bite your bottom lip." He demonstrates, and despite everything, I almost smile. "You had that look this afternoon."

That he notices these things makes something warm unfurl in my chest.

"My mom found your book," I admit. "She wasn't happy about it."

Jack's jaw tightens. "I didn't mean to get you in trouble."

"It's not your fault. Everything gets me in trouble lately. Wanting to go to college, not wanting to marry Tommy, talking to you." I hitch my purse higher on my shoulder. "According to everyone in my life, I'm making terrible choices."

"Are you?"

The question hangs in the night air, simple and devastating.

"I don't know anymore. Maybe they're right. Maybe I'm being selfish and ungrateful and stupid." The words taste bitter on my tongue.

Jack is quiet for a long moment, his eyes never leaving mine. Then: "Want to go for a ride?"

My breath catches. "What?"

"A ride. On the motorcycle. Up the coast highway." He nods toward the bike. "I'll have you home by midnight. Scout's honor."

"Were you a scout?"

"No. But the offer still stands."

I should say no. It's late, my parents would be furious, and this is exactly the kind of thing Rita and my mother warned me about. Boys like Jack, motorcycles, late nights—nothing good comes from that combination.

But I'm so tired of being good. So tired of doing what everyone expects while my dreams get dismissed as a waste of time.

"I've never been on a motorcycle before," I say.

"I know. That's why I'm asking." He watches me carefully. "But if you say no, I'll leave. No hard feelings. No pressure. Just thought you might want to see something beautiful instead of going home to another lecture about appropriate boundaries."

How does he know exactly what I need?

"Why?" I ask. "You don't even know me."

"I know enough." He pulls his spare helmet from the motorcycle. "I know you're smart and you dream about journalism even though everyone calls it impractical. I know you write about people who feel trapped. I know you're braver than you think."

My throat tightens. No one has ever seen me like that.

"Is that enough?" he asks quietly.

It's about trust.

I think about going home to the same routine, the same expectations, the same slow suffocation. About Mom's words: *Your college dreams are a waste of time*. About Tommy's assumptions. About Rita saying we all grow up and accept reality.

And I think about *timshel*. Thou mayest. You have a choice.

"Midnight?" I say. "You promise?"

Something like relief crosses Jack's face. "Midnight. I promise."

He hands me the helmet. Jack steps closer, helps me position it, adjusts the strap under my chin.

"You'll sit behind me, feet on these pegs, and hold onto my waist. Lean with me on turns. Trust the bike. Trust me."

Jack swings onto the motorcycle. He looks back, waiting.

This is it. The moment of choice.

I step forward and awkwardly climb onto the seat behind him. The motorcycle is warm from the day's sun, and I'm suddenly very aware of how close Jack and I are—my thighs against his, my chest nearly pressed to his back. This proximity feels dangerous and thrilling all at once.

"You good?" he asks over his shoulder.

"I think so." My voice comes out steadier than I feel.

"Arms around my waist. Hold on tight."

I wrap my arms around him, and even through the leather jacket I can feel the solid warmth of him, the lean muscle, the steady rise and fall of his breathing. My heart is pounding so hard I'm sure he can feel it. This is really happening. I'm really doing this.

Jack kicks the engine to life, and the motorcycle roars awake beneath us. The vibration runs through my entire body, terrifying and thrilling.

"Ready?" he calls back.

No. Yes. I don't know.

"Ready," I say.

And just like that, we're moving. The wind whips past, and I tighten my grip on Jack, convinced I'll fall, but I don't. The motorcycle is steady beneath us, and Jack drives smooth and confident, like he was born on this machine.

We leave Seaside Heights behind, heading north on the coast highway. Ocean stretches dark and endless to our left, cliffs rise to our right, stars scatter overhead like spilled salt. I've lived near this ocean my whole life, walked its beaches, served Cherry Cokes to tourists who came to see it. But I've never seen it like this—never felt this freedom of movement, this exhilaration of choosing a direction and going.

Jack opens the throttle, and we fly down the dark highway. The speedometer climbs. I should be terrified. Instead, I feel more alive than I've ever felt.

After twenty minutes, Jack slows and pulls off at a scenic overlook I've driven past a hundred times but never stopped at. He kills the engine, and the sudden silence is almost shocking.

We sit for a moment, my arms still around his waist, both of us breathing hard.

"You okay?" he asks.

I release my grip and climb off the bike, my legs shaky. When I pull off the helmet, I'm grinning so wide my face hurts.

"That was—" I can't find the words. "That was amazing."

Jack smiles, a real smile that transforms his entire face. "Yeah?"

I join him at the railing, and for a while, we just stand there, looking at the ocean under stars.

"What would you write about this?" Jack asks.

I think about it. "I'd write about how you can live somewhere your whole life and never really see it. About how I've been looking at this ocean from the beach and the diner, but never from up here. From this angle, it looks bigger."

"That's good."

"And about how sometimes you need someone to show you a different view before you realize you've been looking at things wrong."

I lean on the railing. "My whole life, everyone's been telling me what to want. Stay in Seaside Heights. Take over the diner. Marry Tommy. But what if what I have isn't what I want?"

"Then you choose something different."

"It's not that simple."

"Ruthie, you're seventeen. You're not locked into anything yet. You can apply to college, pursue journalism, figure out what you actually want."

"And what about everyone who's counting on me?"

"What about you? Who's counting on you to count on yourself?"

The question hits like a punch.

I feel something shifting inside me. A recognition that maybe I don't have to live the life everyone else has planned.

"You're so certain you can just choose and go."

"Because I've spent the last year doing exactly that." His voice goes rough. "It's not always better. Sometimes choosing means losing everything. Sometimes it means being alone."

"But you're also free?"

"Yeah. That's the trade-off. Freedom costs security."

"Thank you for showing me this."

"We should head back. Don't want to break my midnight promise."

The ride back is different—not scared anymore, just exhilarated. I hold onto Jack and lean into the turns and feel the thrill of movement.

He drops me off two houses from mine at 11:58 PM, exactly as promised.

When I hand back the helmet, our fingers brush, sending sparks up my arm.

"Same time next week?" he asks.

I should say no. But I'm still flying from the ride, still feeling the possibility in my chest.

"Yes," I say.

Jack's smile is worth every risk.

I watch him ride away, then slip into my house. The lights are off, and I creep to my room without waking my parents.

Only when I'm safely behind my closed door do I let out my breath.

I've just been on a midnight motorcycle ride with Jack Malone. I've just chosen something for myself.

And it felt like the most honest thing I've ever done.
