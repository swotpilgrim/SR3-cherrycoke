# Chapter 3: The Stranger Arrives

The Tuesday afternoon shift is always the slowest. The breakfast rush is long over, the lunch crowd has cleared out, and it's too early for the dinner families. Just me, Rita refilling salt shakers, and a handful of regulars nursing coffee and killing time before they have to go back to whatever their real lives are.

I'm wiping down menus—a task that doesn't really need doing but keeps my hands busy—when I hear it.

The roar of a motorcycle, loud and unmistakable, cutting through the sleepy afternoon quiet like a knife.

Rita's head snaps up. Through the plate-glass window, we all watch as a gleaming black motorcycle pulls into the parking lot, chrome catching the sunlight. The engine cuts off, leaving a ringing silence in its wake.

The rider swings off the bike in one fluid motion. He's wearing a black leather jacket despite the June heat, and when he pulls off his helmet, I see dark hair and a profile that could cut glass. He hangs the helmet on the handlebar and heads toward the diner entrance.

"Well," Rita says, her voice loaded with meaning. "That's a type we don't usually see around here."

She's right. Seaside Heights gets tourists in station wagons and families in sensible sedans. We get locals in pickup trucks and boys like Tommy in their fathers' hand-me-down Chevrolets. We don't get motorcycles. We definitely don't get boys who look like they rode in from somewhere dangerous.

The bell above the door jingles, and he walks in.

Up close, he's even more striking. Maybe nineteen or twenty, with dark eyes that sweep the diner in one assessing glance. There's something coiled about him, like he's ready to leave at any moment. A scar cuts through his left eyebrow, pale against tanned skin. His leather jacket is worn at the elbows, well-loved and broken in.

He doesn't smile. Doesn't greet anyone. Just walks to the counter and takes a seat on the stool directly across from where I'm standing.

Our eyes meet, and something jolts through me—a flash of heat or recognition or pure electricity. I've never seen him before in my life, but there's something in his gaze that makes me feel seen in a way that's both uncomfortable and thrilling.

"Coffee," he says. His voice is low, rough around the edges. "And whatever pie you've got."

"We have apple, cherry, and lemon meringue." I'm proud of how steady my voice comes out.

"Apple. Thanks."

I pour the coffee, hyper-aware of every movement, and my hand only shakes slightly when I set the mug in front of him. He nods his thanks, wraps both hands around the mug like he's cold despite the leather jacket, despite the warm day.

Behind me, I can feel the diner's attention pivot. Mrs. Chen, who was reading a magazine in booth two, is now peering over the top of it. Mr. Morrison has stopped pretending to read his newspaper. Even Rita has paused in her salt shaker project, watching.

I cut a generous slice of apple pie, slide it onto a plate, add a fork. When I set it in front of the stranger, his eyes flick up to mine.

"Thank you," he says, and there's something in his voice—genuine gratitude, like a slice of pie is more than he expected.

"You're welcome."

I should move away, check on other customers, find something else to do. But I'm rooted to the spot, watching him take his first sip of coffee. He drinks it black, no sugar. The kind of person who doesn't soften things.

Diane bursts through the kitchen door with a tray of clean glasses, stops dead when she sees him, and nearly drops the whole tray. I see her eyes go wide, see her mouth form a silent "oh my God" in my direction.

She practically sprints over to where I'm standing, sets the tray down with a clatter.

"Who is *that*?" she whispers, but not quietly enough.

"A customer ordering pie."

"Ruthie, look at him. He's like—like James Dean or something. Do you think he's famous? Maybe he's a movie star traveling in disguise."

"He's probably just passing through town."

"Well, I'm taking my break." Diane whips off her apron, fluffs her ponytail. "You can cover my section, right?"

Before I can answer, she's sliding onto the stool two down from the stranger, leaning on the counter in a pose she probably practiced in front of her bedroom mirror.

"Hi there," she says, sugar-sweet. "I don't think I've seen you around Seaside Heights before."

The stranger glances at her, polite but uninterested. "Just passing through."

"Oh, that's a shame. We've got the best beach in California, you know. And the best diner." She giggles, twirling a strand of blonde hair. "I'm Diane."

"Jack." He turns his attention back to his pie.

Diane waits for more—a last name, a story, some indication of interest. When none comes, she tries again. "Are you staying in town long?"

"Don't know yet."

It's a dismissal, gentle but firm. Diane's smile falters. She's not used to boys being immune to her charms. After another awkward moment, she slides off the stool and retreats to the kitchen, throwing me a bewildered look over her shoulder.

Rita appears at my elbow, her voice low. "That boy's trouble, Ruthie. I've seen his type before. Drifters don't come to beach towns for the scenery."

"He's just having pie, Rita."

"Mm-hmm." She doesn't sound convinced. "Just you be careful. Boys like that—" She doesn't finish the sentence, just shakes her head and goes back to her salt shakers.

I busy myself with refilling coffee for Mr. Morrison, clearing Mrs. Chen's empty juice glass, wiping down the already-clean counter. But I'm aware of every movement Jack makes. The way he eats his pie slowly, methodically. The way his eyes track me as I move through the diner. The book I notice now, tucked into his jacket pocket—just the spine visible, worn and well-read.

When his coffee cup is half-empty, I refill it without being asked. He looks up, a flicker of something—surprise? appreciation?—crossing his face.

"You didn't have to do that."

"It's my job."

"Still." He pauses. "What's your name?"

I should probably not answer. Rita's warning is fresh in my mind, and I can feel her watching from across the diner. But there's something in the way he asks—not entitled or demanding, just genuinely curious.

"Ruthie."

"Ruthie." He says it like he's testing how it sounds. Then, almost to himself: "Suits you."

I don't know what to say to that, so I move away, checking on my other customers even though no one needs anything. When I glance back, Jack has pulled the book from his pocket—I catch a glimpse of the title, something by Steinbeck—and is reading while he finishes his pie.

A boy on a motorcycle who reads Steinbeck. Who has scars and shadows but says "thank you" like he means it. Who looked at Diane like she was wallpaper but watches me like I'm a puzzle he's trying to solve.

Trouble, Rita said. And she's probably right.

The bell jingles as a family of tourists comes in—parents and three sticky children fresh from the beach. I seat them in booth six, take their order for milkshakes and burgers, fall back into the familiar rhythm of the job.

When I return to the counter, Jack is standing, pulling out his wallet. He leaves three dollars for a seventy-five cent slice of pie and a coffee.

"The rest is for you," he says when I start to make change.

"That's too much."

"It's what it was worth." He tucks his wallet away, picks up his helmet from the counter where he'd set it. "Thank you, Ruthie."

The way he says my name sends a shiver down my spine that has nothing to do with the air conditioning.

He heads for the door, and I think that's it. Another customer passing through, someone I'll never see again. Just a story to tell Diane later, about the mysterious stranger on the motorcycle who left a too-big tip and read Steinbeck.

But at the door, he pauses. Turns back.

Our eyes meet across the diner, and for a moment, everything else falls away. The clatter of dishes, Rita's disapproving hmph, the children in booth six arguing over straws. It's just him and me and something unspoken passing between us.

Then he's gone. The bell jingles behind him, the motorcycle roars to life, and through the window I watch him ride away up the coast highway, a dark figure against the bright afternoon.

The diner explodes.

"Did you see that boy?" Mrs. Chen leans out of her booth. "That jacket, that motorcycle. Someone should tell the sheriff—"

"He seemed perfectly polite to me," Mr. Morrison counters.

Rita appears at my elbow again. "Three dollar tip on a seventy-five cent order. Either he can't count or he's trying to make an impression."

"Maybe he's just generous," I say.

"Generous." Rita snorts. "That's one word for it. Ruthie, honey, I know that type seems exciting, but—"

"He just had pie, Rita. He's probably gone already, on his way to wherever he's going."

"Mm-hmm." She gives me a long look. "And if he comes back?"

"He won't," I say.

But even as the words leave my mouth, I know they're a lie. Or maybe a hope. Or maybe both.

I tuck the too-big tip into my apron pocket and try to focus on the tourist family's order. But my hands are shaking slightly as I fill their milkshake glasses, and I can still feel the weight of Jack's gaze like a physical thing.

Diane corners me by the soda fountain. "Oh my God, Ruthie, he looked at you. Did you see? He barely glanced at me but he *looked* at you."

"You're imagining things."

"I am not! And that tip! Ruthie, he's into you. The mysterious stranger is into you!"

"He's not into anyone. He's passing through."

But my heart is pounding, and when I glance out the window toward the empty highway, I'm not thinking about Tommy's sweet smile or our walk on the beach. I'm thinking about dark eyes and worn leather and a boy who reads Steinbeck and says my name like it means something.

Rita's right. He's trouble.

And for the first time in my careful, planned-out life, trouble looks a lot like possibility.

The afternoon shift stretches on. I serve coffee and pie and Cherry Cokes to tourists who'll forget me before they hit the highway. I smile and nod and play my role.

But inside, something has shifted. Like a door opening in a room I didn't know existed.

I don't know if I'll ever see Jack Malone again.

But I know that for those few minutes, sitting at my counter with his book and his coffee, he saw me. Really saw me. Not the good daughter or the dutiful girlfriend or the future diner owner.

Just Ruthie. With kind eyes.

And that feels more real than anything Tommy's said to me in two years.
