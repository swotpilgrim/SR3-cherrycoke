# Chapter 22: Ruthie's Dark Night

I lay on my bed in darkness, still wearing my clothes, and stared at the ceiling. The house was silent except for my father's snoring and occasional creaks. Outside, the world felt empty.

I'd never felt more alone.

Jack was leaving at sunrise. In hours, he'd ride out of Seaside Heights, out of my life. I couldn't stop him.

The tears had stopped, but the ache remained, making it hard to breathe. Was this heartbreak? This hollow, crushing weight?

I pulled my journal from under my pillow. The familiar weight was comforting. I opened it, uncapped my pen.

Where did I begin?

*Everything is falling apart,* I finally wrote. *Jack's leaving. Tommy hates me. My parents are furious. The whole town judges me. And I'm starting to wonder if everyone was right all along.*

My hand shook as I wrote, but once I started, the words poured out.

*Maybe I was foolish. Tommy offered security, and I said no publicly. My parents built a business for me, and I rejected it. For what? For a boy leaving at sunrise. For schools I might not get into. For the possibility I chose wrong.*

I paused. It sounded like defeat, like everyone else had been right.

But something in me resisted.

*No,* I wrote more forcefully. *That's not fair. That's everyone else's narrative, not mine.*

I underlined it twice, pressing hard enough that the pen nearly tore through the paper.

*Tommy offered me HIS future and assumed I'd want it. A house, a role. He never asked what I dreamed about.*

*He assumed. Everyone assumed. Maybe I let them by never speaking up, by being the good girl who never caused trouble.*

*Until Jack.*

My pen hovered over his name. Just seeing it written there made my chest ache.

*Jack didn't save me. He didn't rescue me from my life or talk me into abandoning my future. He just... saw me. Really saw me. And by seeing me clearly—the parts that wanted more, that dreamed bigger, that felt trapped—he made it impossible for me to keep pretending those parts didn't exist.*

*He didn't ruin my life. He woke me up to the fact that I was sleepwalking through it.*

I stopped writing, my throat tight. Was that true? Or was I just making excuses for the wreckage of the past month?

The public proposal. The breakup. The judgment. The fights with my parents. Jack leaving.

If I could go back to that moment on the bandstand, to Tommy on one knee with his grandmother's ring, knowing everything that would follow—would I still say no?

My heart answered before my head could catch up: Yes.

*Yes,* I wrote. *Even knowing everything. Even knowing Jack would leave and my parents would be furious and the town would judge me. Even knowing it would hurt this much.*

*Because saying yes would have been a different kind of hurt. A slower, quieter suffocation. I would have woken up at thirty or forty, Tommy's wife, Pop's Diner owner, still dreaming about the life I might have had if I'd been brave enough to try.*

*That would have been worse. That would have been unbearable.*

The realization settled into my bones with the weight of truth.

*Jack is leaving because he's afraid. He thinks he's poison, that everyone he touches gets hurt. He's so convinced he's unworthy of good things that he can't accept one when it's offered. And I'm heartbroken about that. I'm devastated that he won't stay and fight for us.*

*But his leaving doesn't mean I was wrong.*

*It means he's damaged in ways I can't fix. It means his fear is bigger than his love, at least right now. It means we won't get the ending I hoped for.*

*But it doesn't mean I should have stayed with Tommy. It doesn't mean I should give up on college. It doesn't mean I should shrink back into the good girl role and let everyone else decide my future.*

The pen moved faster now, my hand cramping but unable to stop.

*Here's what I know: I want to go to college. I want to study journalism. I want to write about real people and real stories. I want to leave Seaside Heights and see what else is out there. I want to become someone I can barely imagine right now—someone brave and independent and true to herself.*

*Those wants are real. They mattered before Jack, they matter now that he's leaving, and they'll matter after he's gone.*

*Jack helped me see them clearly. He encouraged them. He made me feel like they were possible. But they were always mine. He didn't create them. He just illuminated what was already there.*

I paused, wiping tears from my cheeks. When had I started crying again?

*So yes, I'm heartbroken. Yes, I wish he'd stay. Yes, I wish he could see that he's worthy of being loved, that staying doesn't make you weak, that running doesn't keep you safe.*

*But I can't force him to believe those things. I can't make him stay if he's determined to go. I can't save him from his own fear any more than he could save me from mine.*

*All I can do is keep moving forward. Apply to colleges. Work toward my dreams. Build the life I want, even if it's harder and scarier than the one everyone else wanted for me.*

*Even if I have to build it alone.*

The thought sat heavy on the page. Alone. Was that what I wanted? To face everything—college applications, my parents' continued anger, the town's judgment, all of it—by myself?

No. But I'd do it anyway if I had to.

*I loved him,* I wrote, the admission stark on the page. *I think I still love him, even though he's leaving. Even though he's choosing fear over us. Love doesn't just stop because the person you love makes a choice you hate.*

*But loving him doesn't mean losing myself. It doesn't mean giving up my dreams or accepting that I was wrong to want more. It doesn't mean everyone else was right.*

*It just means I have to be even braver now. Brave enough to keep going without him. Brave enough to face my parents and tell them I'm applying to colleges whether they help me or not. Brave enough to walk through this town with my head up, even when people whisper.*

*Brave enough to choose myself, even when that choice costs me everything I thought I wanted.*

The sky outside my window was starting to lighten—the deep black giving way to dark blue. Dawn was coming. In an hour, maybe less, Jack would leave.

I had one more chance to stop him. I could climb out my window, run to Murphy's Garage, beg him to stay. Throw myself at his feet and make promises about long distance and waiting and not needing him to be anyone but himself.

But would that change his mind? Or would it just make both of us more miserable?

*I can't make someone stay who's determined to leave,* I wrote. *And I won't beg someone to love me enough to fight for us. That's not how love is supposed to work.*

*So I'm letting him go. Not because I don't care. Not because I've given up. But because forcing someone to stay when they want to leave just creates a different kind of prison.*

*I know about prisons. I've been living in one—one built from expectations and good girl rules and other people's plans for my future. I finally broke out of that prison. I won't build another one, even if it means losing him.*

More tears fell, spotting the page, but I kept writing.

*He told me he was leaving before anyone was awake. That means he doesn't want a scene. Doesn't want me chasing him, begging, making it harder. Maybe that's cowardly. Maybe it's practical. Either way, it's his choice.*

*And I have to respect it, even though it's breaking my heart.*

The sky was definitely lighter now. Predawn gray replacing the darkness. He'd be packing his motorcycle soon. Checking the straps on his duffel. Taking one last look at the room above Murphy's Garage.

Riding away.

*Goodbye, Jack,* I wrote, my tears falling freely now. *Thank you for seeing me. Thank you for encouraging my dreams. Thank you for helping me find the courage to choose myself, even though you can't seem to find that courage for yourself.*

*I hope you find peace somewhere down that highway. I hope you learn that running doesn't heal the wounds you carry—it just takes them to new places. I hope someday you're brave enough to stay.*

*But I'm not waiting for that day. I'm not putting my life on hold hoping you'll come back. I'm moving forward, toward college and journalism and whatever future I can build.*

*You helped me start building it. And I'll always be grateful for that, even if it hurts like hell to lose you.*

*But I'm not losing myself. Not for you, not for anyone.*

*That's the one thing I'm sure of, sitting here at dawn with a broken heart and an uncertain future: I'm choosing me. No matter what it costs.*

*That has to be enough.*

I closed the journal, holding it against my chest like a shield. Outside, the sky was turning pink and gold. Sunrise. The beginning of a new day.

The day Jack Malone would ride out of my life.

The day I'd start figuring out how to move forward without him.

I lay back on my bed, exhausted but somehow lighter. The pain in my chest remained, sharp and real. But underneath it was something else—a core of steel I hadn't known I possessed.

I'd survived the public proposal. I'd survived breaking up with Tommy. I'd survived my parents' fury and the town's judgment.

I'd survive this too.

And maybe—maybe—on the other side of this pain, I'd find the person I was meant to become. The girl who chose herself. The girl who was brave enough to want more, even when more came with a cost.

The girl who didn't need saving because she'd learned to save herself.

As the sun rose fully, painting my room in golden light, I closed my eyes.

Tomorrow I'd climb out of bed and face my life. Tomorrow I'd start the hard work of moving forward.

But for now, I let myself rest. Let myself grieve. Let myself feel the full weight of losing someone I loved.

Because that's what brave people did. They felt their pain fully, honestly, without flinching from it.

And then, when dawn came, they got up and kept going anyway.
