# Chapter 25: Jack's Fear and Hope

"Wait."

The word stopped me mid-step, three feet away from him, already turning toward shore. I froze, my heart hammering.

"Please," Jack said, his voice rough. "Wait."

I turned back slowly. He was still gripping the pier railing, his knuckles white, his whole body trembling with the effort of what he was about to say.

"I'm terrified," he said.

The admission hung in the air between us, raw and honest.

"I'm terrified," he repeated, louder now, like saying it twice made it real. "I've never stayed anywhere. Not really. Not since I left Nevada. Every town, every job, every person—I'm gone before they can get too close. Before they can see that there's nothing special underneath the leather jacket."

"Jack—"

"Let me finish." He finally let go of the railing, turned to face me fully. "You said I need to hear you. Well, you need to hear me too. Because I've been lying to both of us, and I can't do it anymore."

I stayed silent, giving him space.

"I told myself I was leaving for you. For your own good. So you could fix things with your parents, go to college, have the future you deserve." His laugh was bitter. "But that's bullshit. I'm leaving because I'm scared."

The ocean rolled beneath us, endless and patient.

"I'm scared because I've been in Seaside Heights for two months," Jack continued. "Two months. That's the longest I've stayed anywhere since I was seventeen. And you know why?"

I shook my head.

"You." The word came out like a confession. "Because of you. Because every time I thought about packing that duffel bag and riding north, I'd remember our conversations on this pier. Or the way you look when you're writing in your journal. Or how your whole face lights up when you talk about journalism."

My chest tightened.

"I've been falling for you since that first day at the diner," Jack said. "When you poured my coffee and our hands almost touched and I felt something I hadn't felt in years—hope. Stupid, dangerous hope that maybe this time could be different."

"It's not stupid—"

"It is when you're me." He ran a hand through his hair, agitated. "My mother left when I was twelve. Just packed her bags and walked out. No note, no explanation, no goodbye. And my dad—" His voice cracked. "My dad loved her. Really loved her. And she destroyed him. He drank himself into nothing because he couldn't handle being left."

I took a step closer, drawn by his pain.

"So I learned young that love is dangerous," Jack continued. "That caring about people gives them the power to wreck you. And the only way to protect yourself is to leave first. Always leave first, before anyone can abandon you."

"But that's not protection," I said gently. "That's just loneliness."

"Yeah." He met my eyes. "Yeah, it is. But loneliness is safe. Predictable. You can't be destroyed by loneliness because there's nothing left to destroy."

"Jack—"

"I've been alone for six years," he said. "Moving from town to town, working whatever jobs I could find, never staying long enough to matter to anyone. And I told myself that was freedom. That not being tied down meant I was in control."

"And now?"

"Now I know I was just running." His voice dropped to barely above a whisper. "Running from the scared twelve-year-old whose mother didn't love him enough to stay. Running from the fear that maybe there's something wrong with me that makes people leave."

My heart broke for him. "There's nothing wrong with you."

"Isn't there?" He laughed, but it was a broken sound. "Everyone who's ever been close to me has ended up worse off. My mother left. My father drank. And you—look at what knowing me has cost you. Your boyfriend, your reputation, your parents' approval. I'm poison, Ruthie. It's not dramatic—it's just true."

"No." I closed the remaining distance between us. "You're hurt. There's a difference."

"What's the difference when the result's the same?"

"The result isn't the same." I took his hands, forcing him to feel my conviction. "Your mother leaving wasn't about you being poison—it was about her being unable to handle her own life. Your father's drinking wasn't your fault—it was his choice, his damage. And me?" I squeezed his hands. "What I've lost isn't because of you. It's because I chose honesty over performance. That was my choice."

"But I influenced that choice—"

"You witnessed it." The distinction was crucial. "You didn't create my doubts about Tommy or my dreams about college. You just made it impossible for me to keep ignoring them."

Jack's eyes were bright with unshed tears. "I don't know how to do this."

"Do what?"

"Stay." The word came out strangled. "I don't know how to stay when everything in me is screaming to run. I don't know how to be close to someone without waiting for the other shoe to drop. I don't know how to believe this could work."

"Do you want it to work?" I asked carefully. "Is that what you're saying?"

He was quiet for a long moment, the war between fear and hope playing out across his face.

"Yes," he finally said. "God help me, yes. I want to stay in Seaside Heights. I want to keep working at Murphy's. I want to take those night classes Mr. Murphy mentioned. I want to—" He swallowed hard. "I want to be with you. However that looks. Whatever form that takes."

Hope flared in my chest, dangerous and bright.

"But I'm terrified," he continued. "Terrified I'll mess it up. Terrified you'll realize I'm not worth the trouble. Terrified that this feeling—" he pressed my hand against his chest, against his racing heart, "—will end up destroying us both."

"It might," I said honestly. "There are no guarantees, Jack. I can't promise we'll make it. I can't promise long-distance will work when I leave for college. I can't promise your fear will go away or that loving me will be easy."

"So why try?"

"Because the alternative is spending the rest of our lives wondering what if." I moved even closer, until we were breathing the same air. "You taught me that. You taught me that choosing what you want, even when it's scary, is braver than accepting what's safe."

"I didn't mean for you to apply that lesson to me," he said, but there was the ghost of a smile.

"Too late." I smiled back through my tears. "You made me brave, Jack Malone. Now you have to deal with the consequences."

"And what if I fail? What if I try to stay and I can't do it? What if the fear gets too big and I run anyway?"

"Then you run," I said simply. "And it will hurt like hell, and I'll be furious and heartbroken. But at least we'll both know we tried. At least you'll know you were brave enough to stay as long as you could."

"That's not much of a guarantee."

"No. But it's honest." I brought his hands to my lips, kissed his knuckles gently. "I don't need promises of forever. I just need you to try. To stay as long as you can. To be honest with me when it gets hard. To tell me if you need to leave instead of just disappearing."

"I can do that," he said quietly. "I can try."

"Then that's enough."

Jack pulled me close, wrapping his arms around me like I was the only solid thing in a tilting world. I felt his heart hammering against mine, felt his breath shaky in my hair.

"I've never had anyone want to keep me before," he said. "Everyone's always been relieved when I left. Easier. Less complicated."

"I'm not relieved." I pulled back to look at him. "I'm scared and hopeful and terrified and excited. But I'm not relieved. I want you to stay."

"Why?" The question was plaintive, vulnerable. "Why me? You could have anyone—someone stable, someone with a future, someone who isn't carrying around this much damage."

"Because you see me." It was that simple and that complicated. "Because you encouraged my dreams even when it meant we'd be apart. Because you're honest even when honesty is hard. Because underneath all that fear and hurt, you're kind and thoughtful and brave in ways you don't even recognize."

"I'm not brave—"

"You are." I touched his face. "You're standing here, aren't you? Instead of riding away like every instinct is telling you to? That's brave."

"It doesn't feel brave. It feels like jumping off a cliff."

"Yeah." I smiled. "Love kind of does."

Jack's breath caught. "Love?"

I hadn't meant to say it. But now that it was out there, hanging between us, I couldn't take it back. Didn't want to.

"Love," I confirmed. "I love you, Jack. Not the idea of you, not the rebellion you represent. You. The real, damaged, scared, running-from-his-past you. I love you."

"Ruthie—"

"You don't have to say it back." I rushed on before he could feel pressured. "I'm not saying it to trap you or make you stay or—"

"I love you too."

The words were quiet, but they landed like thunder.

"I've loved you for weeks," Jack continued, his voice stronger now. "Maybe since that night on the coast highway when you told me about your dreams. Maybe since you first read me your journal entries. I don't know when it happened, just that it did."

My heart was so full it hurt.

"And it terrifies me," he admitted. "Because everyone I've ever loved has left or been destroyed. But you're right—running from that fear doesn't protect me. It just makes me alone."

"So you'll stay?" I hardly dared to ask.

"I'll try." He cupped my face with both hands. "I'll try to stay. I'll try to build something here. I'll try to be brave enough to let you in completely. And when you leave for college, I'll try to make that work too."

"Even though it's scary."

"Especially because it's scary." His smile was tentative but real. "You said choosing what you want even when it's terrifying is braver than accepting what's safe. So I'm choosing you. Choosing us. Choosing to try."

I kissed him then—gentle, careful, full of promise and hope and all the fear we both carried. When we pulled apart, the sun was higher in the sky, morning fully arrived.

"What now?" I asked.

"Now we figure it out." Jack took my hand, laced our fingers together. "Together."

"Together," I agreed.

And standing on that pier with the ocean beneath us and the whole uncertain future ahead, it felt like enough.

It felt like everything.
