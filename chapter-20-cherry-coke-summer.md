# Chapter 20: Sneaking Out

Three days of living like a prisoner, shuttling between the diner under my mother's watchful eye and my bedroom where my parents monitored me like guards.

Three days without seeing Jack. Without freedom. Without breathing.

By Thursday night, I was desperate.

My parents had gone to bed early. I lay fully clothed, waiting. Listening to the house settle—my father's snoring, floorboards creaking, the kitchen clock ticking.

At eleven-thirty, I moved.

Shoes in hand, pillows arranged under my blanket. Window unlatched. Route mapped—oak tree branch close to the roof, trellis that could bear my weight.

I'd never snuck out before. Good Girl Ruthie Davis didn't do this.

But Good Girl Ruthie Davis was gone.

The window slid open. Night air hit my face, warm and salt-tanged. I climbed onto the narrow roof strip, heart hammering. The oak branch was closer than I remembered. I grabbed it, tested it, swung myself onto it.

The climb down was terrifying—every creak impossibly loud. But I made it to the ground, free.

I pulled on my shoes and ran.

The streets were quiet. My footsteps echoed as I headed toward the pier—our place.

He was there. Standing at the end, staring at dark water.

"Jack," I called softly.

He turned. "Ruthie. Jesus, I've been worried sick. When you didn't show up, when your mom wouldn't let me talk to you—"

I ran and threw my arms around him. He held me tight. Everything else fell away.

"I'm grounded," I said against his chest. "My parents found out about us. They've forbidden me from seeing you."

Jack's arms tightened. "That's why you haven't been at the diner?"

"My mom's been watching me like a hawk during my shifts. They won't let me out of their sight." I pulled back to look at him. "I had to sneak out my window tonight just to see you."

"Ruthie, if they catch you—"

"I don't care." But even as I said it, I knew it wasn't quite true. I did care. I just cared more about this, about us, about not losing the one person who understood.

"You should care." Jack's voice was strained. "This is exactly what I was afraid of. I'm causing problems between you and your parents. I'm making your life harder. I'm—"

"Don't." I put my hand over his mouth. "Don't you dare finish that sentence. You're not making anything worse. They are. By trying to control me, by not listening, by refusing to see that I have the right to choose my own life."

Jack pulled my hand away gently. "But what if they're right? What if I am bad for you?"

"You're not—"

"Ruthie, look at the situation. You've lost Tommy. Your parents are furious. The whole town is judging you. Your reputation is damaged. And it's all connected to me. To us."

"It's connected to me choosing myself," I corrected. "Jack, I didn't refuse Tommy's proposal because of you. I refused it because marrying him would have killed something essential in me. You just helped me see that clearly."

"And look where that clarity got you." Jack gestured helplessly. "Grounded. Sneaking out windows. Fighting with your family. Is this really better?"

"Yes!" The word burst out of me. "Yes, it's better. Because I'm not lying anymore. I'm not pretending to be someone I'm not. I'm finally being honest about what I want."

"And what do you want?" Jack's question was quiet, almost fearful.

I looked at him—really looked at him. The boy who'd ridden into town on a motorcycle and seen past every wall I'd built. Who'd encouraged my dreams even when it meant we'd be apart. Who'd trusted me with his pain and taught me that being vulnerable was braver than being guarded.

"I want to go to college and study journalism. I want to write about the world. I want to grow and learn and become who I'm meant to be." I took his hands. "And I want you in my life while I'm doing it. However that looks. Whatever form that takes."

Jack's expression was anguished. "What if I can't give you that? What if me being here, me being part of your life, makes everything harder? What if the smart thing, the right thing, would be for me to leave?"

My blood ran cold. "Leave? You're thinking about leaving?"

"I'm thinking about what's best for you." Jack's voice cracked. "Every person who's ever cared about me has been hurt or left worse off. My mother couldn't handle our life. My father drank himself into nothing. And now you—you're fighting with your parents, sneaking out windows, risking everything. What if I'm poison, Ruthie? What if everyone who gets close to me ends up damaged?"

"That's not true." I gripped his hands tighter, desperate to make him understand. "Your mother leaving wasn't your fault. Your father's drinking wasn't your fault. And my choices—they're mine. Not yours. You don't get to take responsibility for my decisions."

"But I influenced them. I encouraged you to apply to colleges, to chase your dreams, to want more—"

"You validated feelings I already had!" I was almost shouting now, frustration and fear making my voice sharp. "Jack, I was suffocating long before you showed up. You didn't create my doubts about Tommy or my dreams about journalism or my need to leave Seaside Heights. You just made me brave enough to admit them out loud."

"And now you're paying the price for that bravery."

"So what?" I threw up my hands. "What's the alternative? I go back to pretending? I tell my parents you're right, they're right, I was wrong about everything? I say yes to the life they want and let my dreams die quietly? That's not bravery, Jack. That's cowardice."

"It's safety," Jack countered. "It's not rocking the boat. It's accepting a good-enough life instead of risking everything for a maybe."

"I don't want good enough!" The words echoed across the pier. "I don't want safe and small and suffocating. I want more. I want to try. I want to fail if I'm going to fail, but at least fail reaching for something real instead of succeeding at becoming someone I'm not."

Jack was quiet for a long moment. "What if we don't make it? What if you go to San Francisco and realize I'm just some summer thing? What if I'm not worth all this damage?"

"What if you are?" I shot back. "What if this—us, what we have—is exactly as real as it feels? What if we could figure out the long-distance thing? What if you staying in Seaside Heights and me going to college is exactly what we both need to grow into who we're meant to be?"

"That's a lot of what-ifs."

"Life is what-ifs." I stepped closer to him. "There are no guarantees, Jack. Not with Tommy and the safe life. Not with you and the uncertain one. Not with college or careers or anything. All we have is what we choose and how we choose it."

"And you're choosing this? Even knowing it means fighting your parents, dealing with town judgment, sneaking out windows like a criminal?"

"I'm choosing me," I said firmly. "And right now, me includes you. Includes college applications and journalism dreams and yes, fighting my parents because they're wrong about this. They're wrong to try to control me. They're wrong to forbid me from seeing you. And I won't let them make my choices for me."

Jack pulled me close, his forehead resting against mine. "You're so brave. Braver than I've ever been."

"You're staying in one place after years of running. That's brave too."

"I'm terrified," he admitted. "Terrified I'll mess this up. Terrified you'll realize I'm not worth the trouble. Terrified of caring this much and losing you anyway."

"I'm terrified too," I whispered. "But I'd rather be terrified and trying than safe and slowly dying inside."

Jack kissed me then—soft and desperate and full of all the fear and hope we both carried. When we pulled apart, the world felt simultaneously more fragile and more solid.

"So what now?" Jack asked. "You sneak back in and we what, wait for your parents to come around?"

"I keep applying to colleges. I keep working toward my dreams. I see you when I can, how I can. And I don't give up." I managed a shaky smile. "What about you? Are you staying? Or are you going to run because it's hard?"

"I'm staying." Jack's voice was firm now, decision made. "I'm staying in Seaside Heights. I'm working at Murphy's. I'm figuring out how to put down roots. And when you leave for college, I'll be here. Writing letters. Visiting when I can afford it. Being the person you can come back to."

"Promise?"

"Promise." He kissed my forehead. "No disappearing. No silent goodbyes. If it ends, we say it out loud. Remember?"

"I remember."

We stayed on the pier until after midnight, talking about the future—his job, my applications, how we'd make it work. It wasn't perfect. But it was ours.

When Jack walked me back, we stopped at the corner.

"You good?" he asked, eyeing the oak tree.

"Terrified. Going up will be worse than going down."

"You climbed out a window and across town to see me. You can do this." He smiled. "I'll wait. Make sure you're safe."

The climb back was as terrifying as I'd feared. Twice I almost slipped. Once I froze, certain I'd fall. But I made it—to the roof, through the window, back to my room.

I looked out the window one last time. Jack was still there at the end of the street, watching. When he saw me, he raised his hand in a wave. I waved back, then closed the window quietly.

Three days until my next evening off. Three days until I might be able to see him again without risking life and limb on tree branches.

But it had been worth it. Seeing him, talking to him, knowing we were on the same page about fighting for this—it had been worth the risk.

I crawled into bed exhausted, my clothes still smelling like salt air and Jack's leather jacket. Tomorrow I'd face my parents' supervision again. Tomorrow I'd keep playing the role of the grounded daughter while secretly applying to colleges and planning my escape.

But tonight, I'd chosen myself. I'd chosen us. I'd chosen brave over safe.

And that felt like victory.
