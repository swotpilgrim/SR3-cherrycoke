# Chapter 8: Freedom on Two Wheels

The second Thursday comes both too fast and too slow. All week I've been counting down to 10 PM, to Jack, to that feeling of freedom and choice.

I haven't told anyone. Not Diane, not Tommy, definitely not my parents who think I've stopped talking to "that motorcycle boy."

The week crawls by—morning shifts, Cherry Cokes, Tommy's suffocating attention, my parents' expansion plans that assume I'll be here forever. But underneath the routine, I'm vibrating with anticipation.

When Thursday arrives, I work my closing shift in barely contained excitement. At 10:00 exactly, I lock the diner door and step into the parking lot.

Jack is already there, waiting in the same spot under the streetlight. When he sees me, he smiles—that rare, genuine smile that makes him look younger and less guarded.

"Punctual," he says, handing me the helmet.

"So are you."

"I've been here since 9:45."

My heart skips. I put on the helmet, climb onto the motorcycle behind him. This time it feels less terrifying, more like coming home. I wrap my arms around his waist, and the contact feels right.

"Where are we going?" I ask.

"North. I want to show you something."

The engine roars, and we're off. Out of Seaside Heights, up the coast highway, past last week's overlook. The ride is longer this time—forty minutes of dark ocean, darker cliffs, bright stars. I lean into Jack's back and watch the world blur past.

Finally, Jack slows and turns off onto a dirt road I've never noticed before. We bump along for a few minutes, then emerge onto a secluded beach, small and protected by rocky outcroppings on either side.

He kills the engine, and the silence is profound. Just waves and wind and the distant cry of a seabird.

"Where are we?" I pull off the helmet.

"Twenty miles north. No one comes here—too hard to access. Thought you'd like it."

The beach is perfect—untouched sand, driftwood, the ocean rolling in steady. Above us, the Milky Way stretches clear across the sky.

"It's beautiful," I breathe.

"Yeah." But when I glance at Jack, he's looking at me, not the beach.

We walk to the water's edge. I slip off my shoes, letting cool sand squish between my toes. I feel wild and free and more myself than I ever do in Seaside Heights.

"How do you feel?" Jack asks.

I think about the question, trying to articulate the sensation in my chest.

"Small," I say finally. "But in a good way. Like my problems are small too. From here, the argument with my mom about college seems manageable. Tommy's assumptions seem like something I can actually address instead of just accepting. The future seems—" I pause. "Like something I get to choose instead of something that just happens to me."

Jack nods like he understands exactly what I mean. "That's what riding does for me. Gives me perspective. When I'm moving, when there's wind and road and nothing but choices about where to go next, everything else shrinks down to manageable size."

We walk in silence, listening to waves.

"Can I ask you something? About the people you write about—are you writing about yourself?"

The question feels honest coming from Jack.

"Yeah. I am." I pick up a shell. "I'm terrified of waking up at forty and realizing I never even tried to want something different. That I let other people's plans become my life because I was too scared to make my own."

"You're seventeen. You have time."

"Do I? In six months I graduate. Everyone expects me to work at the diner, get engaged to Tommy. A year from now, engaged. Two years, married. Five years, running the diner with kids and no memory of ever wanting something else."

"Then don't let that happen."

"How? When everyone I love wants it to happen? When saying no means disappointing my parents and being the selfish girl who thought she was too good for her own family?"

Jack faces me directly. "Living your own life isn't selfish. It's necessary. If you don't choose yourself, no one else will."

"My parents would say that's exactly the kind of selfish thinking that ruins lives."

"Your parents had the chance to choose their own lives. Your dad opened the diner because he wanted to, right? That was his dream, his choice. Why don't you get the same right to choose yours?"

The logic is so simple and so devastating that I have no answer.

"What if I choose wrong?" I whisper. "What if I go to college and fail? What if I pursue journalism and discover I'm terrible at it? What if I give up everything I have for something I don't even want once I get it?"

Jack picks up a piece of driftwood, smooth and weathered by years of ocean. "What if you stay and spend your whole life wondering? Which regret is bigger—trying and failing, or never trying at all?"

We look at each other in the starlight, and I feel something shift between us. A deepening of whatever connection has been building since that first day in the diner.

"Can I tell you something?" Jack's voice goes quiet. "About why I ride, why I keep moving?"

"Yes."

"I'm running." He throws the driftwood into the ocean, watches it disappear into the dark water. "From my past, from the person I was, from a future that looked a lot like my father's drunk, angry, stuck existence. I told myself I was choosing freedom, but really I was just choosing not to be trapped. There's a difference."

"What's the difference?"

"Freedom is moving toward something. Running is moving away." He turns to me. "You asked what I dream about, and I said finding a place I could stay. That's true. But the deeper truth is I'm terrified of staying anywhere because staying means being vulnerable. It means people can hurt you, disappoint you, leave you. If I keep moving, I stay in control."

The honesty in his voice breaks something open in my chest.

"So why are you telling me this? Why show me this beach, why wait for me on Thursday nights?"

Jack steps closer, and even in the darkness I can see the intensity in his eyes.

"Because you make me want to stay," he says simply. "You make me think that maybe staying somewhere, building something real, isn't the same as being trapped. That maybe it's possible to choose a place and a person and still be free."

My heart is pounding so hard I'm sure he can hear it over the waves.

"I've never had anyone encourage my dreams before," I admit. "Tommy dismisses them. My parents call them impractical. Rita says everyone has dreams when they're young and then we grow up. But you—you actually think I should go to college. Leave Seaside Heights. Try."

"Of course you should try. Ruthie, you're smart and observant and you see people clearly. That's exactly what good journalism needs. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either lying or doesn't know what they're talking about."

"But you barely know me. How can you be so sure?"

"Because I've been watching you. I see how you handle the rush with grace, how you remember what every regular orders, how you notice when people need encouragement. I've seen how you write like it matters, like documenting people's stories is important work. You're already doing journalism, Ruthie."

No one has ever believed in me like this. Jack believes with a fierce certainty that makes me want to believe in myself.

"What if leaving means losing everything?"

"Then you'll build something new. Something yours. And you won't be alone."

"Jack—"

"I don't have all the answers." His voice is rough. "But if you choose to go, to try, to chase your dreams—I'll be on your side. However that looks."

I stand on this secret beach with a boy who sees me completely.

I take his hand. His fingers close around mine, warm and solid.

"Thank you," I say. "For showing me this place. For making me feel like wanting more isn't wrong."

"It's not wrong. It's the most right thing about you."

We stand there, holding hands, listening to the ocean. And for the first time since I started dreaming about journalism and college and life beyond Seaside Heights, I don't feel guilty for wanting them.

I feel like myself.

Eventually, Jack checks his watch. "It's 11:15. We should head back if I'm going to keep my midnight promise."

The ride back is different. I'm not just holding on anymore—I'm part of the machine, part of the movement. I lean into the curves without thinking, trust the bike and Jack completely, and feel the exhilaration of speed and choice and possibility.

When we pull up two houses from mine at 11:57, I'm breathless and glowing.

"Same time next week?" Jack asks as I hand back the helmet.

"I don't know if I can wait a whole week."

The words are out before I can think them through, but I don't take them back. Because they're true.

Jack's smile is slow and devastating. "The diner's open tomorrow. I'll be there at 2:30."

"You're always there at 2:30."

"Yeah. And you're always there too. That's my favorite part of the day."

He says it simply, like it's just a fact, but it makes my heart soar.

I watch him ride away, then slip into my dark house. Safe behind my closed door, I pull out my journal.

*Tonight Jack took me to a secret beach. We talked about dreams and running and moving toward something. He told me I'm already doing journalism, that wanting more isn't wrong. And he told me I make him want to stay.*

*When I'm with Jack, I feel more real than I do anywhere else. Like the version of myself I've been hiding can finally breathe.*

*Is this what falling in love feels like?*

I close the journal, mind spinning with starlight and ocean and Jack's hand in mine.

Tomorrow he'll be at the diner at 2:30. We'll pretend we're just customer and waitress while knowing we're so much more.

And next Thursday, we'll ride again.

For the first time in my life, the future doesn't feel like a trap. It feels like possibility.
