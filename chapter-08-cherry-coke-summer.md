# Chapter 8: Freedom on Two Wheels

The second Thursday comes faster than I expected and slower than I wanted. All week, I've been counting down—not to the weekend or my days off, but to 10 PM on Thursday when Jack promised to meet me again.

I haven't told anyone. Not Diane, who would squeal and demand details. Not Tommy, who's been extra attentive lately, sensing my distance even if he can't name it. Definitely not my parents, who think I've taken their warnings to heart and stopped talking to "that motorcycle boy."

The week crawls by in a haze of routine—morning shifts, coffee pots, Cherry Cokes, Tommy's sweet but suffocating attention, my parents' plans for the diner expansion that assumes I'll be here forever.

But underneath the routine, I'm vibrating with anticipation. Because Thursday at 10 PM means Jack. Means freedom. Means the feeling of wind and speed and choosing something for myself.

When Thursday finally arrives, I work my closing shift in a state of barely contained excitement. Rita notices.

"You're awful chipper for someone scrubbing grease traps," she comments.

"Just happy it's Thursday," I say, which isn't exactly a lie.

At 9:55, I finish my closing tasks in record time. At 9:58, I hang up my apron and grab my purse. At 10:00 exactly, I lock the diner door and step into the parking lot.

Jack is already there, waiting in the same spot under the streetlight. When he sees me, he smiles—that rare, genuine smile that makes him look younger and less guarded.

"Punctual," he says, handing me the helmet.

"So are you."

"I've been here since 9:45."

The admission makes my heart skip. He's been waiting, eager, anticipating this as much as I have.

I put on the helmet without needing help this time, and when I climb onto the motorcycle behind him, it feels less terrifying and more like coming home. I wrap my arms around his waist, and this time, the contact doesn't make me nervous. It feels right.

"Where are we going?" I ask.

"North. I want to show you something."

The engine roars to life, and we're off. The route is familiar now—out of Seaside Heights, up the coast highway, the ocean black and endless to our left. But instead of stopping at the scenic overlook from last week, Jack keeps going.

The ride is longer this time, maybe forty minutes, and I stop worrying about falling or holding on too tight. Instead, I lean into Jack's back and watch the world blur past—dark ocean, darker cliffs, stars so bright they look close enough to touch.

Finally, Jack slows and turns off onto a dirt road I've never noticed before. We bump along for a few minutes, then emerge onto a secluded beach, small and protected by rocky outcroppings on either side.

He kills the engine, and the silence is profound. Just waves and wind and the distant cry of a seabird.

"Where are we?" I pull off the helmet, and my hair tumbles free.

"About twenty miles north of Seaside Heights. No one comes here—it's too hard to access from the road. But I found it last week and thought—" He pauses. "Thought you'd like it."

We dismount, and I look around in wonder. The beach is perfect—untouched sand, driftwood scattered like sculptures, the ocean rolling in with steady rhythm. Above us, the Milky Way stretches across the sky, so clear I can see the cloudy band of stars.

"It's beautiful," I breathe.

"Yeah." But when I glance at Jack, he's looking at me, not the beach.

We walk down to the water's edge, and I slip off my shoes, letting the cool sand squish between my toes. The water is cold when it touches my feet, but I don't care. I feel wild and free and more myself than I ever do in Seaside Heights.

"How do you feel?" Jack asks.

I think about the question, trying to articulate the sensation in my chest.

"Small," I say finally. "But in a good way. Like my problems are small too. From here, the argument with my mom about college seems manageable. Tommy's assumptions seem like something I can actually address instead of just accepting. The future seems—" I pause. "Like something I get to choose instead of something that just happens to me."

Jack nods like he understands exactly what I mean. "That's what riding does for me. Gives me perspective. When I'm moving, when there's wind and road and nothing but choices about where to go next, everything else shrinks down to manageable size."

We walk in silence for a while, listening to the waves. Then Jack speaks again.

"Can I ask you something? About the people you write about—the ones who feel trapped. Are you writing about yourself?"

The question should feel invasive, but coming from Jack, it just feels honest.

"Maybe. Yeah. I guess I am." I pick up a shell, smooth it between my fingers. "I've never said this out loud to anyone, but I'm terrified of waking up at forty and realizing I never even tried to want something different than what I was given. That I let other people's plans become my life because I was too scared to make my own."

"You're seventeen," Jack says. "You have time."

"Do I? In six months, I'll graduate. Everyone expects me to work full-time at the diner, get engaged to Tommy, maybe take a couple classes at the community college if I'm feeling ambitious. A year from now, I could be engaged. Two years, married. Five years, running the diner with two kids and no memory of ever wanting something else."

"Then don't let that happen."

"How?" The word comes out more desperate than I intended. "How do I not let it happen when everyone I love wants it to happen? When saying no means disappointing my parents and hurting Tommy and being the selfish girl who thought she was too good for her own family?"

Jack stops walking and turns to face me directly. "Ruthie, living your own life isn't selfish. It's necessary. If you don't choose yourself, no one else will."

"My parents would say that's exactly the kind of selfish thinking that ruins lives."

"Your parents had the chance to choose their own lives. Your dad opened the diner because he wanted to, right? That was his dream, his choice. Why don't you get the same right to choose yours?"

The logic is so simple and so devastating that I have no answer.

"What if I choose wrong?" I whisper. "What if I go to college and fail? What if I pursue journalism and discover I'm terrible at it? What if I give up everything I have for something I don't even want once I get it?"

Jack picks up a piece of driftwood, smooth and weathered by years of ocean. "What if you stay and spend your whole life wondering? Which regret is bigger—trying and failing, or never trying at all?"

We look at each other in the starlight, and I feel something shift between us. A deepening of whatever connection has been building since that first day in the diner.

"Can I tell you something?" Jack's voice goes quiet. "About why I ride, why I keep moving?"

"Yes."

"I'm running." He throws the driftwood into the ocean, watches it disappear into the dark water. "From my past, from the person I was, from a future that looked a lot like my father's drunk, angry, stuck existence. I told myself I was choosing freedom, but really I was just choosing not to be trapped. There's a difference."

"What's the difference?"

"Freedom is moving toward something. Running is moving away." He turns to me. "You asked what I dream about, and I said finding a place I could stay. That's true. But the deeper truth is I'm terrified of staying anywhere because staying means being vulnerable. It means people can hurt you, disappoint you, leave you. If I keep moving, I stay in control."

The honesty in his voice breaks something open in my chest.

"So why are you telling me this? Why show me this beach, why wait for me on Thursday nights?"

Jack steps closer, and even in the darkness I can see the intensity in his eyes.

"Because you make me want to stay," he says simply. "You make me think that maybe staying somewhere, building something real, isn't the same as being trapped. That maybe it's possible to choose a place and a person and still be free."

My heart is pounding so hard I'm sure he can hear it over the waves.

"I've never had anyone encourage my dreams before," I admit. "Tommy dismisses them. My parents call them impractical. Rita says everyone has dreams when they're young and then we grow up. But you—you actually think I should go to college. Leave Seaside Heights. Try."

"Of course you should try. Ruthie, you're smart and observant and you see people clearly. That's exactly what good journalism needs. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either lying or doesn't know what they're talking about."

"But you barely know me. How can you be so sure?"

"Because I've been watching you for three weeks. I see how you handle the diner rush with grace even when you're overwhelmed. I see how you remember what every regular orders, how you notice when Mr. Henderson seems sad or when Diane needs encouragement. I've read your notes in that journal—" He stops himself. "Okay, I haven't actually read them. But I've seen how you write like it matters, like documenting people's stories is important work. That's journalism, Ruthie. You're already doing it."

No one has ever believed in me like this. Not even Mr. Henderson, who encouraged me but in that distant, abstract way. Jack believes in me with a fierce certainty that makes me want to believe in myself.

"What if leaving means losing everything?" I whisper. "My family, Tommy, everything familiar?"

"Then you'll build something new. Something yours." He pauses. "And you won't be alone."

The implication hangs in the air between us.

"Jack—"

"I'm not saying I have answers. I'm not saying I know what I'm doing or where I'll be in six months." His voice is rough with honesty. "But I'm saying that if you choose to go, to try, to chase your dreams—I'll be on your side. However that looks."

The waves crash, and the stars wheel overhead, and I stand on this secret beach with a boy who sees me completely and asks nothing except that I see myself the same way.

I take his hand. His fingers close around mine, warm and solid.

"Thank you," I say. "For showing me this place. For making me feel like wanting more isn't wrong."

"It's not wrong. It's the most right thing about you."

We stand there, holding hands, listening to the ocean. And for the first time since I started dreaming about journalism and college and life beyond Seaside Heights, I don't feel guilty for wanting them.

I feel like myself.

Eventually, Jack checks his watch. "It's 11:15. We should head back if I'm going to keep my midnight promise."

The ride back is different. I'm not just holding on anymore—I'm part of the machine, part of the movement. I lean into the curves without thinking, trust the bike and Jack completely, and feel the exhilaration of speed and choice and possibility.

When we pull up two houses from mine at 11:57, I'm breathless and glowing.

"Same time next week?" Jack asks as I hand back the helmet.

"I don't know if I can wait a whole week."

The words are out before I can think them through, but I don't take them back. Because they're true.

Jack's smile is slow and devastating. "The diner's open tomorrow. I'll be there at 2:30."

"You're always there at 2:30."

"Yeah. And you're always there too. That's my favorite part of the day."

He says it simply, like it's just a fact, but it makes my heart soar.

I watch him ride away, then slip into my dark house and up to my room. Safe behind my closed door, I pull out my journal.

*Tonight Jack took me to a secret beach. We talked about dreams and fear and the difference between running away and moving toward. He told me I'm already doing journalism, that I should chase my dreams, that wanting more isn't wrong.*

*And he told me I make him want to stay.*

*I don't know what we are—this thing between us. We're not officially together. We haven't even kissed. But when I'm with Jack, I feel more real than I do anywhere else. Like the version of myself I've been hiding can finally breathe.*

*Is this what falling in love feels like? This terrifying, exhilarating sense that everything is changing and there's no going back?*

I close the journal and lie in bed, my mind spinning with the memory of starlight and ocean and Jack's hand in mine.

Tomorrow he'll be at the diner at 2:30. Tomorrow I'll pour his coffee and pretend we're just customer and waitress while knowing we're so much more than that.

And next Thursday, we'll ride again. We'll find another secret place. We'll talk about dreams and fears and all the things I can't talk about with anyone else.

For the first time in my life, the future doesn't feel like a trap.

It feels like possibility.
