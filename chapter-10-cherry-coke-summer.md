# Chapter 10: Jack's Truth

The next Thursday is different. I can feel it the moment Jack walks into the diner at 2:30. There's a tension in his shoulders, a shadow in his eyes. He orders his usual coffee and pie, but when I serve him, our eyes meet and I see something there—vulnerability, fear, determination all mixed together.

The afternoon drags. I keep glancing at the clock, willing my shift to end, needing to know what's wrong. At 6 PM, when my shift finally ends, I find Jack waiting by his motorcycle in the parking lot.

"Can we skip the ride tonight?" he asks. "Just walk the pier instead?"

"Of course."

We walk to the pier in silence, the weight of unspoken words hanging between us. It's low tide, and the ocean has pulled back, revealing dark sand and tide pools. The sun is setting, painting everything in shades of orange and gold.

At the end of the pier, Jack leans against the railing and takes a deep breath.

"I need to tell you about where I came from. The whole story, not just the pieces."

"Okay." I lean next to him, close enough that our shoulders touch. "I'm listening."

"I told you my mother left when I was twelve. That's true. What I didn't tell you was why." His voice goes rough. "She left because my father was an alcoholic. A mean one. When he drank, which was most nights, he'd get angry. Break things. Break people."

My heart clenches, but I don't interrupt.

"He never hit my mom—not while I was there, anyway. But he screamed. Threw things. Punched walls. Made our house feel like a war zone. I'd hide in my room and pretend I couldn't hear them fighting. Pretend everything was normal."

Jack's knuckles are white where he grips the railing.

"One day I came home from school and her closet was empty. She'd packed while I was at school and left. Just—gone. No note, no explanation. My dad said she couldn't handle our life anymore. He said she was weak. But I knew the truth. She left to save herself, and she left me behind with him."

"Jack—" I reach for his hand, but he pulls away.

"Let me finish. I need to get this all out." He takes a shaky breath. "After she left, Dad got worse. Drank more. I learned to make myself invisible. Learned which floorboards creaked, which doors slammed, how to move through the house without drawing attention. I took care of him when he was passed out drunk. Cleaned up his messes. Made excuses when he missed work."

The image he's painting is devastating. Jack as a twelve-year-old boy, shouldering responsibilities no child should carry.

"By high school, I was working part-time to help with bills because Dad drank away most of his paycheck. I missed classes, missed chances, missed being a normal kid. And I told myself it was fine. That I was being responsible. That someone had to take care of him."

"But you dropped out," I say gently.

"Yeah. Junior year. Dad got fired from the cannery for showing up drunk. I had to take on more hours to keep the lights on. School stopped making sense when I was too tired to do homework and too worried about whether we'd have food to focus on algebra."

Jack finally looks at me, and his eyes are filled with old pain.

"One night—this was about a year ago—I came home late from my shift at a gas station. Dad was drunk, angrier than usual. He started yelling about my mother, about how she abandoned us, how women always leave. Then he started yelling about me. How I was just like her. How I'd leave too as soon as I could."

"Did you fight back?"

"No. I just—I realized he was right. I was like her. Not in a weak way, but in a survival way. I needed to leave or I'd drown in his misery." Jack's voice cracks. "So that night, after he passed out, I packed my duffel bag. Took the money I'd been saving—about three hundred dollars. And I left."

"You bought the motorcycle with that money?"

"Found it cheap from a guy two towns over. Spent most of my savings on it. Figured if I had a bike, I could go anywhere. Work odd jobs, keep moving, never get trapped again."

He turns to face me fully now, his expression raw.

"I've been running for a year, Ruthie. Town to town, job to job. I'd stay a few weeks, make some money, then move on before anyone could expect anything from me. Before I could get attached. Before anyone could leave me again."

"But you stopped here," I say. "In Seaside Heights."

"I stopped here because I saw you through the diner window that first day. You were serving Cherry Cokes and smiling even though your eyes looked sad. And I thought—" He pauses. "I thought maybe I could stay long enough to figure out your story. Why a girl with kind eyes looked so sad."

Tears are streaming down my face now.

"But then I got to know you. And it stopped being about curiosity and started being about—" He takes my hands. "About how you made me feel like maybe I wasn't poison. Like maybe staying somewhere wasn't the same as being trapped. Like maybe I could build something real instead of just running from everything."

"Jack, you're not poison. You're—"

"I'm terrified." The admission comes out fierce and desperate. "I'm terrified that if I stay, if I build something with you, if I let myself love you completely—you'll leave like my mother did. Or I'll fail you like I failed my father. Or something will go wrong and I'll end up back where I started, broke and alone and wondering why I bothered trying."

I cup his face in my hands, making him look at me.

"Listen to me. You didn't fail your father. He failed you. You were a child. It was never your job to save him."

"But I left him—"

"You survived. That's what you did. You survived." My voice is fierce now. "And your mother leaving—that wasn't about you either. She was saving herself the only way she knew how. It's not fair that she left you there, but Jack, her leaving doesn't mean you're unlovable. It means she was drowning and couldn't save both of you."

He's crying now, silent tears streaming down his face, and my heart is breaking for the twelve-year-old boy who thought his mother's leaving was his fault, for the teenager who raised himself while raising his father, for the young man who's been running for a year because staying felt too dangerous.

"I love you," I say clearly. "And I'm not leaving. Not because you're trapping me or because I don't have other choices. But because choosing you and choosing my dreams are the same choice. You're the one who made me brave enough to want more."

"What if I let you down?"

"What if you don't?" I press my forehead to his. "Jack, you've spent a year running from the fear that everyone leaves. But I'm right here. I'm choosing you. I'm choosing us."

"Even if it's hard? Even if your parents hate me and the town judges you and Tommy gets hurt?"

"Even then." I pull back to meet his eyes. "You told me that wanting more isn't selfish—it's necessary. Well, I want more. I want journalism school and a future I choose and you. I want all of it."

Jack kisses me.

It's sudden and sweet and desperate all at once. His hands cup my face, and mine tangle in his hair, and for a moment there's nothing but this—the taste of salt from our tears, the warmth of his lips on mine, the feeling of falling and flying simultaneously.

When we pull apart, we're both breathing hard, both smiling through tears.

"I've wanted to do that for weeks," Jack admits.

"Me too."

We stand there on the pier, holding each other as the sun sets completely and the stars begin to appear. The ocean whispers below us, and the world feels both vast and intimate.

"I got the job," Jack says into my hair. "In San Francisco. The mechanic shop called yesterday. They want me to start in two weeks."

"You took it?"

"I told them I'd let them know by Friday. I wanted to talk to you first." He pulls back to look at me. "If you're really applying to San Francisco State, if you're really choosing that future—I want to be there. Not to follow you or control you, but to build something alongside you. Is that crazy?"

"No. It's not crazy. It's—" I can't find words big enough. "It's everything."

"I'm still going to be scared," he admits. "Still going to worry that I'm not good enough, that I'll mess this up somehow."

"Me too. I'm terrified of leaving my parents, of disappointing everyone, of failing at college. But Jack—" I take his hands. "I'd rather be scared together than safe and alone."

"Together," he repeats, like he's testing the word. "That sounds good. That sounds really good."

We kiss again, slower this time, and it feels like a promise. Like we're sealing something important, making it real.

When we finally pull apart, Jack checks his watch. "It's only nine. Want to ride up the coast? I know a spot where the stars look close enough to touch."

"Always."

We walk back to his motorcycle hand in hand, and when we ride this time, it feels different. Not like escape or rebellion, but like movement toward something. Toward a future we're choosing together.

At the overlook, we lie on our backs on the warm hood of the motorcycle, looking up at the vast expanse of stars.

"Tell me your plan," Jack says. "All of it."

"Okay." I take a breath. "I'm going to fill out my college application this week. Mr. Henderson said he'd help with my essay and write a recommendation. I'll apply to San Francisco State for journalism."

"Good. What else?"

"I'll talk to Tommy. Tell him the truth—that I care about him but I don't love him the way he deserves. That I want different things."

"That'll be hard."

"Yeah. But it's necessary." I squeeze Jack's hand. "And then I'll tell my parents. About college, about leaving, about you."

"They're going to hate me."

"Probably. But they'll come around eventually. Or they won't. Either way, I can't let their fears dictate my life anymore."

Jack is quiet for a moment. Then: "I'm proud of you. You know that?"

"You've told me. But I like hearing it."

"I'm proud of you," he repeats. "For being brave enough to want more. For choosing yourself even when it's hard. For—" He turns to look at me. "For choosing me too."

"Always," I say. "I'll always choose you."

We lie there under the stars, making plans and promises, and for the first time, the future doesn't feel like something to fear. It feels like something to build.

Together.

Two weeks until the end of summer. Two weeks until everything changes. Two weeks to tell Tommy and my parents and brave the storm that's coming.

But tonight, lying under the stars with Jack's hand in mine, I feel invincible.

I feel free.

And I feel loved.

That's enough. That's everything.
