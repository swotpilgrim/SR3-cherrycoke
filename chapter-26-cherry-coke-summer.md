# Chapter 26: Building Something Real

We walked along the beach, hand in hand, the morning sun warm on our faces. The pier was behind us now, our dramatic declarations settling into something quieter but no less real. We'd said we loved each other. We'd agreed to try.

Now came the hard part: figuring out what "trying" actually meant.

"So," Jack said finally, breaking the comfortable silence. "College."

"College," I agreed.

"Tell me about it. The real plan, not the dream version. What schools are you actually applying to?"

I took a breath, organizing my thoughts. "Mr. Henderson thinks I should aim for San Francisco State. It's got a strong journalism program, and it's more affordable than Berkeley or Stanford. He said he'd help with application fees and recommendation letters."

"San Francisco." Jack's voice was neutral, but I felt his hand tighten slightly around mine. "That's... that's good. Big city, lots of opportunities."

"It's also eight hours away," I said quietly. "If you're staying in Seaside Heights."

"I am." He said it firmly, like he needed to convince himself as much as me. "Mr. Murphy offered me a permanent position at the garage. Good pay, room to advance. He even mentioned I could take night classes at the community college if I wanted."

"Do you want to?"

Jack was quiet for a moment, the only sound our footsteps in the sand and the crash of waves. "I dropped out of high school at seventeen," he said eventually. "Never thought about going back to school. But maybe... maybe yeah. If I'm going to stay in one place, build something—I should probably finish what I started."

Pride swelled in my chest. "That's wonderful."

"It's terrifying." But he smiled when he said it. "Two months ago I was drifting from town to town with no plan past the next paycheck. Now I'm talking about permanent jobs and night classes and—" He stopped walking, turned to face me. "And trying to figure out how to make this work when you'll be in San Francisco and I'll be here."

"We could write letters," I offered. "People do long-distance."

"In 1957, long-distance means letters that take three days to arrive and phone calls that cost a fortune." Jack wasn't being pessimistic, just realistic. "We need to be honest about how hard that's going to be."

I appreciated his honesty, even as it scared me. "You're right. It will be hard."

"And you'll be meeting new people. College kids, journalism students, people with plans and ambitions and—" He ran a hand through his hair. "People who aren't high school dropouts working in garages."

"Jack—"

"I'm not fishing for compliments." He cut me off gently. "I'm being practical. You're going to grow and change. That's the whole point of college. And I'm going to be here, working on cars and taking night classes at community college. We're going to be living very different lives."

"Does that mean you don't think we can make it?" My voice came out smaller than I intended.

"No." He pulled me close. "It means I think we need to be really honest about what we're signing up for. About the challenges. About how we'll handle it when it gets hard."

"Okay." I rested my forehead against his chest, feeling his heartbeat. "So let's be honest. What worries you most?"

"That you'll outgrow me," he said immediately. "That you'll meet someone brilliant and successful who quotes Steinbeck and actually understands what you're learning in your classes. Someone your parents would approve of."

The fear in his voice was real, and I understood it. But I also needed him to understand something.

"I might change," I said carefully. "College probably will change me. I'll learn new things, meet new people, have experiences I can't even imagine yet. But Jack—" I pulled back to look at him. "Growing doesn't automatically mean growing apart. People can change and still choose each other."

"Can they?"

"I don't know." I was being as honest as he was. "I've never done this before. But I want to try. And I want you to try too."

"I am trying. That's why I'm still here instead of halfway to Oregon." He touched my face gently. "But Ruthie, you need to understand—if we do this, if we try to make long-distance work, there will probably come a point when it stops working. When the distance is too much or one of us meets someone else or we just... drift."

"I know."

"And when that happens, I need you to promise me something."

"What?"

"Don't ghost me." His voice was urgent now. "Don't disappear. Don't leave me wondering. If it ends, tell me. Out loud. To my face, or in a letter, or over the phone—but tell me. Give me that closure."

I understood immediately. "Like your mother didn't."

"Yeah." The word was heavy. "Like my mother didn't. I can handle being left. I just can't handle the silence. The not-knowing."

I took his face in both hands, making him look at me. "I promise. If this ends, I'll tell you. Honestly and clearly. No disappearing. No silent goodbyes."

"Thank you." The relief in his expression was palpable.

We started walking again, the conversation feeling less daunting now that we'd named our fears.

"What about breaks?" I asked. "Thanksgiving, Christmas, summer? I could come home then. We'd see each other."

"That's months apart between visits." Jack wasn't being difficult, just realistic. "Can you handle that? Can I?"

"I don't know." My honesty matched his. "But lots of people do long-distance. Military couples, people in different cities for work. It's not impossible."

"No." He squeezed my hand. "Just hard."

"We've already established we're choosing hard," I pointed out. "Standing on that pier, telling each other the truth—that was hard. This is just a different kind of hard."

Jack laughed, and it sounded more genuine now. "When did you get so wise?"

"Since a boy on a motorcycle taught me to stop pretending and start living."

We found a quiet spot on the beach and sat down, our backs against a large piece of driftwood. The ocean stretched endlessly before us, and I thought about distance—how the water could be both vast and crossable.

"Tell me about your plan," I said. "The staying-in-Seaside-Heights plan. What does it actually look like?"

Jack was quiet for a moment, gathering his thoughts. "Keep working at Murphy's. Save money. Take night classes—maybe start with getting my GED, then see about some college courses. Automotive technology, maybe. Or business, if I ever want to open my own shop someday."

"You're thinking long-term."

"That's new for me." He smiled, but there was vulnerability in it. "I've never thought past the next town. But yeah, I guess I am. Thinking long-term."

"And in this long-term plan... where do I fit?"

"Everywhere." The word came out fierce. "You fit everywhere, Ruthie. Whether you're here or in San Francisco or halfway around the world. You're—" He struggled for words. "You're the reason I'm even thinking long-term. You made me believe I could have a future worth planning for."

My eyes stung with tears. "You're going to make me cry again."

"Sorry." But he was smiling.

"What about us, though? Practically speaking. Do we... I don't know, are we together? Are we boyfriend and girlfriend? Are those even the right words?"

"I don't know what the right words are." Jack turned to look at me fully. "But I know I want to be with you. I know I want to write you letters and save up for phone calls and visit when I can afford the bus fare to San Francisco. I know I want you to come home on breaks and spend time with me before you have to go back. I know—" He took a breath. "I know I want to try to make this work, whatever 'this' is."

"Together but separate," I said. "Living our own lives but choosing each other anyway."

"Yeah. That." Jack's expression was vulnerable. "Is that enough? Is that too much?"

"It's exactly right." I kissed him, gentle and sure. "We both get to grow and change and pursue our dreams. But we choose to stay connected. No promises of forever, just promises of honesty."

"Honesty I can do."

"Good." I leaned against his shoulder, comfortable in the silence that followed.

We sat there for a while, watching the waves roll in, both of us processing everything we'd said. It wasn't a perfect plan. There were no guarantees, no promises that love would be enough to bridge the distance. But it was honest. It was real.

And it was ours.

"When do you apply?" Jack asked eventually.

"Applications are due in November for spring admission. Mr. Henderson's helping me with essays."

"So you'd leave in January?"

"If I get in. If I can figure out financial aid. If a million things fall into place." I sighed. "It's not certain yet."

"But you're trying."

"I'm trying." I squeezed his hand. "Just like you're trying to stay. We're both being brave."

"Scared and brave at the same time."

"The best kind of brave," I said.

Jack stood up, pulling me with him. "I should get you back before your parents send out a search party. You're already late for your shift."

"They're probably furious." I'd been gone for hours, missed my shift completely. There would be consequences.

"Worth it?"

I looked at him—really looked at him. Jack Malone, who'd been so close to riding away. Who'd stopped, turned back, listened. Who'd admitted his fears and chosen to stay anyway. Who was holding my hand like I was something precious.

"Worth it," I confirmed.

We walked back toward town slowly, neither of us in a hurry to end this moment. We'd made our choice. We'd committed to trying. Nothing was certain, but everything felt possible.

"Ruthie?" Jack said as we reached the edge of the beach.

"Yeah?"

"Thank you. For running to that pier. For not letting me leave believing I was poison. For—" His voice caught. "For choosing me."

"Thank you for letting me," I said simply.

We stood there in the morning light, two people who'd almost lost each other, who'd been brave enough to tell the truth. The future stretched ahead—uncertain, challenging, probably painful at times.

But we'd face it together, even when together meant being apart.

And somehow, that felt like enough.

It felt like exactly enough.
