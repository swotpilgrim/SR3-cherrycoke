# Chapter 4: The Daily Regular

He comes back the next day at 2:30 PM.

I'm refilling the sugar dispensers when the motorcycle roar announces his arrival, and my heart does this stupid little jump that I immediately try to suppress. Through the window, I watch Jack swing off the bike, pull off his helmet, run a hand through his dark hair.

Rita notices my distraction. "Told you he'd be back."

"He's just a customer."

"Mm-hmm." She doesn't believe me any more than I believe myself.

Jack takes the same seat at the counter—third stool from the right, directly in my section. This time when our eyes meet, there's the faintest hint of something in his expression. Not quite a smile, but close.

"Coffee and apple pie?" I ask.

"You remember." He sounds surprised.

"It's what you ordered yesterday."

"Still. Most people don't pay that much attention."

I pour his coffee, cut his pie, set both in front of him without comment. But my hands are steadier today, and when he says thank you, I manage a small smile in return.

He pulls out his book—a different one today, I notice, the cover worn almost to illegibility—and reads while he eats. Every so often, his eyes flick up to watch me work. Not in a creepy way, but like he's genuinely interested in the mechanics of refilling coffee pots and wiping down counters.

Diane practically materializes at my elbow the moment I step away from Jack's spot.

"He came back," she hisses. "Oh my God, Ruthie, he came back for you."

"He came back for pie."

"At exactly the same time as yesterday? Please. That boy is interested."

"That boy hasn't said more than ten words to me."

"Yet." Diane grins. "He hasn't said more than ten words yet. Trust me, I know these things."

But she doesn't try to flirt with him again. Some instinct tells her it would be pointless.

Day three, Jack arrives at 2:30 on the dot. Same seat, same order. This time, I don't have to ask.

"Coffee and apple pie, coming right up."

He does smile then, just a quirk of his mouth, but it transforms his whole face. Makes him look younger, less guarded.

Rita, passing by with a tray of dirty dishes, mutters just loud enough for me to hear: "Boy's establishing a pattern. That's how it starts."

"How what starts?"

She just gives me a knowing look and disappears into the kitchen.

I set Jack's coffee and pie in front of him, and this time I linger for a moment, curiosity getting the better of me.

"You're reading Steinbeck." I nod toward his book. "East of Eden."

He glances down at it, then back at me, something flickering in his dark eyes. "You know it?"

"I've read most of his stuff. The Grapes of Wrath, Of Mice and Men."

"What did you think?"

No one has ever asked me that. Not my teachers, who assigned the books and wanted specific answers. Not Tommy, who thinks reading is something you do for school and then forget. Not even my parents, who wouldn't understand why anyone would read about migrant workers and dust bowls.

"I think—" I pause, trying to put it into words. "I think he sees people clearly. Not how we want to be seen, but how we actually are. The good and the bad all mixed together."

Jack nods slowly. "That's exactly right." He taps the book. "That's what makes him honest. Most writers try to make people into heroes or villains. Steinbeck just shows you people."

We look at each other for a long moment, and it feels like something significant just happened, though I couldn't say exactly what.

"I should—" I gesture vaguely at the rest of the diner. "Other customers."

"Right. Of course."

But as I move away, I feel his eyes following me, and the weight of his attention is starting to feel less unsettling and more... thrilling.

By day five, Jack's 2:30 arrival is part of my routine. I have his coffee poured before he sits down. He has his money ready before I bring the check. We've developed a rhythm, unspoken but precise.

During the afternoon lull, I'm wiping down the counter near his seat when I notice his coffee cup is empty. I reach for the pot at the same moment he pushes the cup toward me, and our fingers brush.

It's nothing. An accidental touch. But I feel it like an electric shock, and when I glance up, his eyes are already on mine.

"Sorry," I say.

"Don't be."

I pour the coffee, and he moves his book so I can wipe the counter in front of him, and it's such a small thing but it feels intimate somehow. Like we're dancing, and both of us know the steps.

The afternoon rush starts—nothing like the morning chaos, but enough to keep me busy for an hour. I'm juggling three tables and a couple at the counter when I notice Jack quietly straightening the menu holders, pushing salt shakers back into place, creating order in the small space around him.

He doesn't make a show of it. Doesn't ask if I need help. Just does these tiny things that make my job a fraction easier.

When the rush dies and I finally have a moment to breathe, I stop by his seat.

"You didn't have to do that. Help with the menus and stuff."

He shrugs. "Looked like you had your hands full."

"Still. Thank you."

"You thank people a lot," he observes. "For things that are just basic decency."

The comment catches me off guard. "I guess I do."

"Makes me wonder who in your life isn't giving you basic decency."

It's such a perceptive thing to say that I don't have a response. Because he's right—I do thank people too much, grateful for the bare minimum. Grateful when Tommy bothers to ask about my day. Grateful when my parents acknowledge I might have an opinion. Grateful when customers aren't rude.

"People are basically decent," I say finally. "Most of them, anyway."

Jack doesn't look convinced, but he doesn't push it. Just returns to his book, and I return to my work, but the conversation sits with me.

Day seven falls on a Saturday, which means the diner is packed. I'm running between tables, Rita is barking orders, Diane is flirting with a group of college boys in booth four, and the jukebox is playing "Don't Be Cruel" for the third time in an hour.

At 2:30, Jack walks in. Takes his usual seat. Waits patiently while I deal with a tourist family who can't decide what they want and a regular who's complaining about the temperature of his eggs.

When I finally make it to Jack's section, I'm frazzled and sweaty and probably have coffee stains on my apron.

"Sorry," I say, pouring his coffee. "Crazy day."

"I can see that." He pauses. "Take a breath."

"What?"

"You're running yourself ragged. Just take a breath. Thirty seconds. The world won't end."

I want to argue, to say I'm fine, but something in his expression stops me. So I do it. I set down the coffee pot, put my hands on the counter, and take a slow, deep breath.

The diner doesn't disappear. The noise doesn't stop. But something in my chest unclenches.

"Better?" Jack asks.

"Actually, yeah."

"Good." He nods toward the kitchen. "Now go get my pie before Rita decides I'm taking up valuable real estate."

It makes me laugh, a real one, and I see Rita's eyebrows shoot up from across the room. Because I'm laughing with the motorcycle boy, the one she warned me about, and I genuinely don't care what she thinks.

The rest of the shift passes in a blur, but every time I refill Jack's coffee or pass his seat, I feel steadier. Like his calm is contagious.

When he gets up to leave, he sets four dollars on the counter. Before I can protest the oversized tip, he speaks.

"You have kind eyes," he says quietly. "I noticed it the first day. But today I noticed something else."

"What's that?"

"You don't treat me like everyone else does. You don't look at the leather jacket or the motorcycle or whatever story you think you know about me." He meets my eyes directly. "You just... see me. Thank you for that."

Then he's gone, the bell jingling behind him, leaving me standing at the counter with four dollars in my hand and my heart doing acrobatics in my chest.

Diane appears immediately. "What did he say? You're blushing!"

"Nothing. Just—nothing."

But it wasn't nothing. It was everything.

For seven days, I've been watching Jack. Noticing the books he reads, the careful way he drinks his coffee, the generous tips he leaves, the quiet help he offers.

But he's been watching me too. Seeing past the pink uniform and the practiced smile to something underneath.

Rita appears at my elbow for what feels like the hundredth time.

"That boy's got you all tied up in knots, doesn't he?"

"Rita—"

"Just be careful, honey. Boys like that—they're not from our world. They don't stay."

"I know," I say.

And I do know. Jack has "temporary" written all over him. He'll ride through town and out again, heading to wherever people like him go when they're done with places like Seaside Heights.

But for now, for these afternoons at 2:30, he's here. Drinking coffee and reading Steinbeck and looking at me like I'm more than just a counter girl serving pie.

That night, I write in my journal:

*Jack Malone comes in at 2:30 every day. Orders coffee and apple pie. Leaves too-big tips. Reads Steinbeck. Has dark eyes and a scar through his left eyebrow and a way of looking at me that makes me feel seen. Rita says he's trouble. Diane says he likes me. I don't know what to think. Except that when he's sitting at my counter, I feel more like myself than I do anywhere else.*

I close the journal and wonder if seven days is long enough to start hoping someone will stay.

Probably not.

But I'm hoping anyway.
