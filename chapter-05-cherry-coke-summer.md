# Chapter 5: Parental Warnings

Dinner at the Davis household is always at six o'clock sharp. Tonight it's meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and green beans at the yellow Formica table—the same Thursday meal we've had for years.

I'm pushing green beans around my plate when Dad clears his throat.

That particular sound—not quite a cough, not quite a word—means he has something important to say.

"So," he begins, cutting his meatloaf with precise movements. "There's been a fellow coming into the diner. Motorcycle."

My fork freezes halfway to my mouth.

Mom looks up, and I see the glance that passes between my parents. The kind of silent communication that comes from twenty-three years of marriage. They've already discussed this. Probably at length.

"Oh?" Mom says, like this is the first she's hearing about it. "What kind of fellow?"

"The kind that causes trouble." Dad's voice is casual, but his eyes find mine across the table. "Leather jacket, drifter type. Rita mentioned he's been in every day this week."

Of course Rita mentioned it. Rita mentions everything.

"He's just a customer," I say, trying to keep my voice neutral. "He orders coffee and pie, pays his bill, leaves a tip. That's it."

"A very large tip, I heard." Mom sets down her fork. "Ruthie, sweetheart, you know that kind of attention isn't appropriate."

"He tips well. That's not a crime."

"No," Dad says slowly. "But it's a red flag. Men like that—they're looking for a certain kind of girl."

My face flushes hot. "What's that supposed to mean?"

"It means," Mom jumps in quickly, "that he might get the wrong impression. You're a nice girl from a good family. You don't want him thinking—"

"Thinking what? That I'm friendly? That I'm doing my job?"

"Carol." Dad's voice cuts through the rising tension. "Let me handle this."

He sets down his knife and fork, folds his hands on the table. When he looks at me, his expression is serious.

"I want to tell you about your Uncle Ray."

I blink. "What?"

"My brother, Ray. You never met him—he died before you were born." Dad's jaw tightens. "Ray was the kind of boy who didn't like rules. Didn't like being told what to do. When he was nineteen, he bought himself a motorcycle with money he'd saved from working at the cannery."

Mom reaches over and touches Dad's hand, but he doesn't pause.

"Ray fell in with a bad crowd. Other boys with motorcycles, boys who drank and fought and thought they were too good for steady work. Started staying out all night, missing shifts at the cannery. My parents tried to talk sense into him, but Ray didn't listen. Said they didn't understand, said he was making his own way."

I have a sinking feeling I know where this story is going.

"One night, Ray and his friends decided to rob a gas station outside of town. Just for kicks, he said later. Just to prove they could. The owner had a gun. Ray's friend pulled a knife. When the police showed up, someone had been stabbed and Ray was an accessory to armed robbery."

Dad's voice is flat now, emotionless in the way people get when they're talking about something that still hurts.

"He went to prison for five years. When he got out, he couldn't stay clean. Kept chasing that same wild freedom he thought the motorcycle gave him. Wrapped himself around a telephone pole going ninety miles an hour on a dark road. He was twenty-six years old."

The kitchen is silent except for the tick of the clock over the sink.

"I'm sorry," I say quietly. "I didn't know."

"No reason you should. It's not a story we like to tell." Dad picks up his fork again. "But I'm telling you now so you understand. Boys like that—boys with motorcycles and leather jackets and no ties to anywhere—they're running from something. And when you're standing still, trying to build a life, they'll drag you down with them."

"Jack isn't—" I stop myself, but it's too late.

"Jack." Mom's voice sharpens. "So you know his name. Ruthie, how many conversations have you had with this boy?"

"A few. We talked about books. That's all."

"Books." Dad shakes his head. "Honey, I'm sure he's very charming. I'm sure he says all the right things. But his type always does. That's how they get nice girls to forget everything they've been taught."

"You don't even know him!"

"I don't need to." Dad's voice goes hard. "I knew my brother. That's enough."

"Ben—" Mom starts, but Dad holds up his hand.

"Ruthie, I'm telling you directly: stay away from that boy. Serve him his coffee and pie if he comes in, but no conversations. No getting friendly. And absolutely no seeing him outside the diner. Do you understand?"

It's not really a question. It's an order.

"He's just a customer," I say again, but my voice sounds weak even to my own ears.

"Good. Then it won't be hard to keep it that way." Dad returns to his meatloaf, the conversation clearly over in his mind.

But Mom isn't done. She reaches across the table and takes my hand, her touch gentle in a way that makes my throat tight.

"Sweetheart, we're not trying to be mean. We're trying to protect you. You have such a good life ahead of you. Tommy is a wonderful boy from a good family—"

"I know." I pull my hand back. "Everyone keeps telling me how wonderful Tommy is."

"Because it's true. He has a steady job, a future, a plan. He'll take care of you." Mom's eyes are soft with concern. "That motorcycle boy—what kind of future can he offer? What kind of stability? He'll break your heart and move on to the next town, and you'll be left here dealing with the pieces."

"Maybe I don't want to be taken care of," I hear myself say. "Maybe I want to take care of myself."

The words hang in the air, too loud, too honest.

Mom and Dad exchange another look.

"Of course you can take care of yourself," Mom says carefully. "But why would you want to, when you have people who love you and want to help?"

Because "help" feels a lot like "control." Because "love" is starting to feel like a cage with my name on it.

But I don't say any of that.

"May I be excused?" I ask instead. "I have homework."

"It's summer," Dad points out.

"Reading, then. I'm reading."

Mom nods, and I escape to my room before they can say anything else about Uncle Ray or motorcycle boys or the wonderful future they've planned for me.

I close the door and lean against it, my heart pounding.

My room is exactly the same as it's been since I was fourteen. Yellow wallpaper, white furniture, pictures of me and Diane, me and Tommy. A good girl's room.

I pull out my journal and sit cross-legged on the bed.

*My parents forbid me from talking to Jack. They've decided he's dangerous because of a motorcycle and Uncle Ray's story from thirty years ago.*

*Maybe Jack IS running from something. Maybe he WILL break my heart and leave. But what scares me more is living the life they've planned for me. Tommy and the hardware store and a house on Sycamore Street and Sunday dinners where nothing matters.*

*Is it so wrong to want MORE?*

I stop writing and stare at the words. Want more. I want more than Seaside Heights offers. More than Tommy's certainties. More than my parents' narrow vision of happiness.

And when Jack looks at me with those dark eyes—I feel like "more" is possible. Even if it's dangerous.

There's a soft knock on my door.

"Ruthie?" Mom's voice. "Can I come in?"

I shove the journal under my pillow. "Sure."

She sits on the edge of my bed. "Your father loves you very much. The story about Ray—that was hard for him to tell. He doesn't want to lose you too."

"He's not losing me. I'm right here."

"Are you? Because lately you seem miles away. Restless."

"I'm fine, Mom."

"With Tommy?"

"I don't know."

Mom pats my hand. "It's natural to have doubts. I had doubts about your father when we were courting. He wanted to open a diner—I thought it was crazy. But he convinced me, and look how it turned out. We have a good life, Ruthie. Stability. Security."

"Don't you ever wonder what else is out there?"

"Not really. Everything I need is right here."

There it is. The fundamental difference between us. Mom is content with Seaside Heights. I'm not. I don't know if I ever will be.

"I'll be more careful at the diner," I say finally. "I'll keep things professional with all the customers."

It's not a promise to stay away from Jack. But it's enough to satisfy her.

Mom kisses my forehead. "That's my good girl. Now get some sleep. You have the breakfast shift tomorrow."

She leaves, closing the door softly behind her.

I pull out my journal again and add one more line:

*They want me to be their good girl. But good girls don't get to want more. Good girls stay where they're put and marry who they're told and dream small, safe dreams.*

*I don't know how to be a good girl anymore.*

Through my window, I can hear the distant crash of waves. Somewhere out there, beyond the beach and the highway and the edge of town, there's a whole world I've never seen.

And somewhere in Seaside Heights, there's a boy with a motorcycle who reads Steinbeck and sees me.

My parents think he's dangerous.

They're probably right.

But danger is starting to look a lot like the only way out.
