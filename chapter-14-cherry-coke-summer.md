# Chapter 14: Jack's Vulnerability

The pier at night had become our sanctuary. Two days after Diane's warning—two days of whispered gossip and my parents' cold silence—I climbed onto Jack's motorcycle and let him take me away from it all.

We settled onto our usual spot at the pier's end. Jack had been quiet during the ride, withdrawn, and now he stared out at the dark water instead of looking at me.

"You okay?" I asked, bumping his shoulder gently.

"Yeah." But his voice said otherwise.

I waited. One thing I'd learned about Jack: he talked when he was ready, not when pushed.

Finally, Jack spoke. "I've been thinking about my mother."

The words were quiet, almost lost in the sound of the waves. This was new territory—Jack had mentioned his mother leaving, but never elaborated. I held very still, afraid to say the wrong thing and make him close up again.

"I haven't talked about her in a long time," he continued. "But being here with you, it brings things up."

"You don't have to—"

"I think I need to." Jack looked at me, pain visible even in the darkness. "I was twelve when she left. Came home from school on a Tuesday. The house was quiet. Not normal quiet, but empty quiet."

He paused, his hands gripping the edge of the pier.

"I went to find her and saw her closet door open. Every hanger was empty. Her shoes were gone from the rack. The bathroom—all her stuff, her hairbrush and perfume and the cream she used—all of it, gone. Like she'd never been there at all."

My chest ached for the twelve-year-old boy discovering his mother had vanished.

"I found my dad in the kitchen, drinking. It was four in the afternoon, but he was already half-drunk. I asked him where Mom was, and he just... laughed. This bitter, awful laugh. He said she was gone. That she couldn't handle our life anymore, couldn't handle him, couldn't handle me. That she'd left that morning while I was at school and wasn't coming back."

"Oh, Jack," I whispered.

"No note. No goodbye." Jack's voice was hollow. "I kept thinking maybe she'd call or write. I checked the mail every day for months. Watched for her car. Jumped when the phone rang."

He swallowed hard. "She never called. Not once. Not for my birthday, not for Christmas. Never."

I reached for his hand, and he let me take it, his fingers cold despite the warm night.

"I spent years wondering what I did wrong," Jack said. "If I'd been quieter, or gotten better grades, or helped more around the house—maybe she would've stayed. My dad said she left because she was selfish, because she couldn't handle real life. But I always wondered if it was because of me."

"It wasn't your fault," I said firmly.

"I know that now. Mostly." Jack's thumb traced circles on the back of my hand. "But knowing something and feeling something aren't the same. Part of me still feels like I must have been too much trouble, too much work. Like there was something wrong with me that made my own mother not want to stay."

The vulnerability in his voice broke my heart. This was the wound underneath everything—the reason he kept moving from town to town, the reason he held people at arm's length, the reason he'd been so scared to let me in.

"After she left, everything got worse," Jack continued. "Dad drank more. I had to get a job at fifteen just to keep us fed. Started missing school. Social workers came by, but Dad could convince them everything was fine. I learned to lie about bruises."

My breath caught. "He hurt you?"

"Sometimes. When he was really drunk." Jack's voice was clinical. "Mostly he was just gone. I took care of him even though he didn't take care of me. I was the adult and he was the child."

"That's not how it should have been."

"No. But that's how it was." Jack finally met my eyes again. "The worst part was being so alone. I couldn't bring friends home—not that I had many friends. Couldn't tell teachers what was really happening. Couldn't rely on anyone but myself. I learned that people leave. People disappoint you. People hurt you. And the only way to protect yourself is to not need them in the first place."

The pieces were falling into place—why Jack had been so guarded, why he'd kept moving, why genuine connection terrified him even as he craved it.

"So I left," Jack said. "Soon as I turned eighteen, I packed a bag, got on my motorcycle, and left. I've been moving ever since."

"Running," I said gently.

"Yeah. Running." He didn't sound defensive. "Every town, I tell myself maybe I'll stay. But then I start caring and I panic. Because caring means getting hurt."

"So you leave first."

"Exactly." Jack's smile was sad. "I've gotten good at it. I can spot when I'm caring too much, and that's when I move on."

"But you haven't left Seaside Heights," I pointed out.

"No." His eyes held mine. "And that scares the hell out of me."

My heart was racing. "Why haven't you?"

"You know why." Jack's voice was rough. "You're why. Somewhere between that first cup of coffee and now, I started caring. Started thinking maybe I could stay somewhere. Build something."

"Jack—"

"But then I think about my mother. How she left without a word. My dad, who drank himself into nothing. And I think, what if I stay and you leave for college and realize you're better off without me?"

"That's not going to happen," I said.

"How do you know?" The question was raw, desperate. "How do you know you won't get to San Francisco and meet people who are smarter than me, who have their lives together, who can give you everything you deserve? How do you know you won't look back at this summer and see me as just some phase you went through?"

"Because I know you," I said fiercely. "I see you, Jack. Not the leather jacket or the motorcycle or whatever story people in town have made up. I see who you really are."

"And who's that?" His voice was barely above a whisper.

"Someone kind and thoughtful and smart. Someone who reads Steinbeck and thinks about the world. Someone who encourages my dreams even when it means we'll be apart. Someone who's been hurt but hasn't let it make him cruel." I squeezed his hand. "Someone worth staying for."

Jack's eyes were bright with unshed tears. "I want to believe that."

"Then believe it." I shifted closer to him. "You're not your mother, Jack. You're not someone who abandons people. And I'm not her either. I'm not going to disappear without a word."

"But you are going to leave." It wasn't an accusation, just a sad fact.

"For college. To chase my dreams. But that doesn't mean I'm leaving you." I touched his face gently. "There's a difference between leaving a place and leaving a person. I can go to San Francisco and still care about you. Still want you in my life."

"Long distance?" Jack's voice was skeptical.

"If that's what it takes. Letters, visits when we can afford it, phone calls." I smiled slightly. "We'll figure it out. Unless you're planning to run first?"

"I don't want to run." Jack covered my hand with his, holding it against his cheek. "For the first time in six years, I actually want to stay. That's terrifying."

"Staying is terrifying," I agreed. "But so is running. At least if you stay, you get to see what happens. You get to build something real."

"What if I'm not good at real?" His vulnerability was completely unguarded now. "What if I mess this up?"

"Then we'll mess it up together." I leaned my forehead against his. "Jack, you don't have to be perfect. You don't have to have everything figured out. You just have to try. That's all any of us can do—just try."

Jack pulled me close, wrapping his arms around me, his face buried in my hair. I felt his shoulders shake slightly and realized he was crying—quiet, controlled tears that he'd probably been holding back for years.

I held him while he let it out, this boy who'd learned too young that showing weakness was dangerous, that needing people was foolish. The waves crashed below us and the stars wheeled overhead and I held him through it all.

When he finally pulled back, his eyes were red but clearer somehow, like releasing the pain had made room for something else.

"Thank you," he said quietly.

"For what?"

"For listening. For not running. For seeing me." Jack wiped his eyes roughly. "Nobody's ever... I've never told anyone all that before."

"I'm glad you told me."

"I'm glad I did too." He managed a small smile. "Feels lighter somehow. Like keeping it secret made it heavier."

"That's how secrets work," I said. "They get heavier the longer you carry them alone."

We sat in comfortable silence for a while, the crisis passed, something new and stronger built in its place. Jack had shown me his deepest wound, and I hadn't flinched. I'd stayed.

"So what now?" I asked eventually.

Jack considered the question. "Now I try to believe that staying is brave instead of stupid. That caring about someone doesn't automatically mean they'll hurt me. That maybe—maybe—this time could be different."

"This time is different," I promised. "Because I'm not leaving you. Not really. Not in the way that matters."

Jack kissed my forehead, gentle and reverent. "I believe you. Or at least, I'm trying to."

"That's enough," I said. "Trying is enough."

We stayed on the pier until after midnight, talking about lighter things now—books we wanted to read, places we wanted to see, dreams that felt more possible in the darkness. And when Jack drove me home, I held onto him tighter than before, understanding now what it cost him to let me in.

Understanding that every time he showed up at the diner, every time he waited for me at the pier, every time he chose to stay another day in Seaside Heights, he was choosing me over his fear.

And that was the bravest thing I'd ever seen.
