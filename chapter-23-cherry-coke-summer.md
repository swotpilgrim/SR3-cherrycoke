# Chapter 23: Racing to the Pier

I must have fallen asleep sometime after the sun rose, because I woke to late morning light streaming through my window and my mother's voice calling up the stairs.

"Ruthie! Your shift starts in twenty minutes!"

My shift. The diner. The routine of my ordinary life, carrying on as if my heart hadn't shattered the night before.

I sat up, my head pounding, my eyes swollen from crying. The journal lay open on my bed, pages covered in my desperate midnight writing. I closed it carefully, ran my hands over the cover.

I'd worked through my pain last night. Found clarity in the darkness. Decided I would move forward, with or without Jack.

But that was before I'd slept. Before my subconscious had time to process everything. Before I'd woken to a new day and realized—

I couldn't just let him go.

Not like this. Not with his last memory of me being tears and desperation in his sparse little room. Not with him riding away believing he was poison, that everyone who cared about him ended up worse off.

I'd told myself last night that I had to respect his choice, that I couldn't force someone to stay. And that was true. I couldn't make Jack stay in Seaside Heights if he was determined to leave.

But I could tell him the truth one more time. I could make sure he knew that he hadn't ruined me—he'd helped me find myself. I could look him in the eye and tell him that whatever happened next, I was grateful for what we'd had.

Even if it ended. Even if he still left.

He deserved to know.

I glanced at my alarm clock. 5:45 AM. Jack had said he was leaving at sunrise, before anyone was awake. That had been hours ago.

Was I already too late?

"Ruthie!" My mother's voice again, sharper this time. "Now!"

I made a split-second decision.

I went to my window, looked down at the oak tree I'd climbed so many times in the past weeks. The route I knew by heart now. The path to freedom—or at least, to choice.

My mother wanted me at the diner. My parents wanted me obedient, grounded, contained.

But I'd spent my whole life doing what other people wanted. And look where it had gotten me—lying awake at night, drowning in regret and what-ifs.

Not anymore.

I grabbed my jacket, shoved my journal in the pocket, and climbed out the window.

The oak tree was easier in daylight. I scrambled down quickly, hit the ground running. My mother would be furious when I didn't show up for my shift. There would be consequences. But consequences were something I'd learned to live with.

I ran.

Not toward the diner, but toward Murphy's Garage. Six blocks felt like six miles as my feet pounded the pavement, my breath coming in gasps. Please let him still be there. Please don't let me be too late.

The garage appeared around the corner—closed on Sunday mornings, the parking lot empty. No motorcycle. My heart sank.

But I had to check. Had to be sure.

I took the external stairs two at a time, stumbled at the top, caught myself. The door to Jack's room hung slightly ajar, moving gently in the morning breeze.

I pushed it open.

Empty.

The sparse room was completely empty. No duffel bag on the bed. No jacket hanging on the back of the chair. No books stacked on the makeshift nightstand. Nothing but bare walls, a stripped mattress, and the faint smell of motor oil and leather that told me he'd been here recently.

But he wasn't here now.

"You looking for Jack?" a voice called from below.

I turned to see Mr. Murphy standing in the garage doorway, wiping his hands on an old rag. His kind, weathered face was sympathetic.

"Yes," I managed. "When did he leave?"

"About two hours ago. Sunrise, just like he said. Packed up his bike, shook my hand, rode off north on the coast highway." Mr. Murphy studied me. "You're the Davis girl, aren't you? From the diner?"

I nodded, unable to speak around the lump in my throat.

"He talked about you, you know. Never said your name, but I knew. Said he had to leave before he caused you more trouble." Mr. Murphy shook his head. "That boy carries too much guilt for things that ain't his fault."

"Did he say where he was going?"

"Just north. Said he'd find work somewhere up the coast, maybe Oregon." Mr. Murphy's expression softened. "I'm sorry, miss. He seemed pretty set on leaving."

Two hours. He'd been gone for two hours, riding north while I'd been sleeping off my emotional exhaustion.

I was too late.

"Thank you," I whispered, and headed back down the stairs on unsteady legs.

The parking lot felt cavernous and empty. Jack was gone. Really, truly gone. And I hadn't gotten to say goodbye, hadn't gotten to tell him—

Wait.

A memory surfaced from one of our late-night conversations, something Jack had said about loving the ocean at sunrise. About how the pier at dawn felt like the edge of the world, peaceful and honest in a way the daytime crowds never were.

"I've watched the sunrise from that pier in probably thirty different towns," he'd told me. "It's my ritual. The one constant thing. Before I leave anywhere, I watch the sun come up over the water one last time."

Before I leave anywhere.

My heart kicked. Jack was leaving Seaside Heights. And if his pattern held, if his ritual mattered—

He'd go to the pier first. One last sunrise. One last look at the ocean before riding north.

I started running again.

Six blocks from Murphy's to the pier felt like running through water. My lungs burned. My legs ached. But I didn't stop, didn't slow. I ran past the diner where my mother was probably wondering where the hell I was. Past Main Street where early risers were setting up for Sunday services. Past the boundaries of my careful, contained life.

Toward the pier. Toward one last chance.

Please let him be there. Please let me not be too late.

The boardwalk stretched ahead, weathered wood and morning shadows. At the end, silhouetted against the bright morning sky—

A figure. Standing alone, looking out at the water.

And beside him, gleaming chrome and black leather: a motorcycle.

Relief hit me so hard I nearly fell. He was there. He was still there.

I slowed to a walk, trying to catch my breath, my hand pressed against the stitch in my side. My legs were shaking. My clothes were wrinkled from sleeping in them. My hair was a mess, my face probably swollen from crying. I looked nothing like the put-together good girl I used to be.

But I was here. That was what mattered.

I walked out onto the pier, my footsteps loud on the wooden planks. Jack turned at the sound, and even from a distance I saw surprise cross his face.

"Ruthie." My name in his voice—rough, confused, pained. "What are you doing here?"

"You said you were leaving before anyone was awake." I kept walking toward him, closing the distance. "You said sunrise."

"I did leave. I've been riding for two hours. I'm just..." He gestured at the ocean, at the pier. "One last look. Old habit."

"I know. You told me about it once. The pier at sunrise ritual." I stopped a few feet away from him, not trusting myself to get closer. "You watch the sunrise before you leave a place."

"Yeah." He looked at me more closely, taking in my disheveled appearance, my breathless state. "Did you run here?"

"From Murphy's Garage. Mr. Murphy said you left hours ago, but I remembered what you said about the pier, and I thought maybe—" I had to stop, catch my breath. "I had to find you before you left. Before it was really over."

"Ruthie, I told you not to come. I told you to let me go."

"I know what you told me." I moved closer, close enough to see the dark circles under his eyes, the tightness around his mouth. "But I couldn't let you leave thinking you ruined my life. Because you didn't, Jack. You didn't ruin anything."

"That's not how it looks from where I'm standing."

"Then you're not looking clearly." My voice was stronger now, conviction replacing desperation. "You're looking through the lens of all your old wounds, all your old fears. But I see things differently."

"Ruthie—"

"No. You listen." I cut him off, taking another step closer. "You told me to go home last night. You told me to forget about you and build the life I'm supposed to have. But the problem is, you're the one who helped me see that there is no life I'm 'supposed' to have. There's only the life I choose."

Jack's jaw clenched, but he didn't interrupt.

"So I need you to hear this before you ride away. I need you to understand something." I took a deep breath, gathering my courage. "You didn't break me. You woke me up. And that's not the same thing."

The sun was fully up now, bright and warm on my face. The ocean sparkled below us. And Jack Malone stood in front of me, his motorcycle packed and ready to go, his fear and hope warring in his dark eyes.

"I have things to say," I told him. "And you're going to listen to them. You owe me that much."

For a long moment, he just looked at me. Then, slowly, he nodded.

"Okay," he said quietly. "I'm listening."

And just like that, I had my chance. My moment to tell the truth, to speak my heart, to claim my own narrative.

The words came easier than I expected.

"Everyone keeps telling me what I want," I began. "Everyone except you. So it's time I told you exactly what I want, in my own words. And you need to hear it before you ride away believing you know what's best for me."

Jack's hands gripped the pier railing. But he stayed. He listened.

And I told him the truth.
