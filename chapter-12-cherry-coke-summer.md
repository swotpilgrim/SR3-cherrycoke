# Chapter 12: Tommy's Suspicions

Saturday night. Date night. The ritual Tommy and I had followed since sophomore year—movie at the Neptune, then the boardwalk. The pattern was so familiar I could navigate it with my eyes closed.

Maybe that was the problem.

Tommy picked me up at seven in his father's Chevrolet. He opened my door, kissed my cheek, asked how my day was. Just like always.

"Fine," I said, sliding into the passenger seat. "Busy at the diner."

"I bet. All those tourists wanting their burgers and fries." Tommy started the engine, his hand briefly touching mine. The touch felt... empty. Like going through the motions.

I pushed the thought away, guilt settling heavy in my stomach. Tommy was a good person. He loved me. He'd never done anything wrong. So why did sitting next to him feel like wearing a coat that didn't fit anymore?

The Neptune was showing "The Bridge on the River Kwai." Tommy bought tickets and popcorn, and we found our usual seats. The lights dimmed, the movie started, and all I could think about was Jack.

I wondered what Jack would think of this film—he'd have insights about duty versus conscience, would connect it to something he'd read. Tommy would just say it was a good war picture.

The thought was unfair, but I couldn't stop comparing them.

Tommy's arm went around my shoulders, and I tensed before forcing myself to relax. His touch used to comfort me. Now it felt like pressure, like expectation. Like the walls of my small life closing in.

"You okay?" Tommy whispered, his breath warm against my ear.

"Fine," I whispered back. "Just tired."

It wasn't a complete lie. I was tired—of pretending, of feeling guilty, of living two separate lives.

After the movie, we walked down to the boardwalk. The evening air was cooling, lights from the arcade sparkling against the darkening sky. We probably looked like any other couple—young, in love, carefree.

Appearances could be deceiving.

"So I talked to my dad today," Tommy said, his voice excited. "He's giving me a raise in September. Says I'm doing really good work at the store."

"That's great, Tommy," I said, trying to inject enthusiasm into my voice.

"And that's not all." He stopped walking, hands on my shoulders. "He's been talking to Mr. Hendricks about that house on Maple Street. The yellow one with the white shutters?"

My stomach dropped. "What about it?"

"They want to sell. Dad thinks we could get it for a good price." Tommy's face glowed. "It's perfect, Ruthie. Two bedrooms, nice yard, walking distance to everything. We could get married in December, move in by January."

Each word felt like another bar sliding into place on a cage. "Tommy—"

"I know we talked about waiting, but why wait? Everything's falling into place. It's perfect."

Perfect. That word again. Perfect for whom?

"That's... that's really soon," I managed.

Meant to be. As if my life was a train on predetermined tracks, and all I had to do was stay on board.

"What about college?" The words came out before I could stop them.

Tommy's smile faltered slightly. "What about it?"

"I've been thinking... maybe I should apply. Mr. Henderson said—"

"Mr. Henderson's been filling your head with ideas again?" Tommy's tone was indulgent. "Look, Ruthie, I know you like to write, and that's fine. But we need to be practical. It's not like you need a degree to work at the diner or be a wife and mother."

The words hit like a slap. He genuinely couldn't understand why I'd want anything different.

"What if I do need it?" I said quietly. "What if I want more than just... this?"

Tommy frowned, finally hearing the strain in my voice. "More than what? A home? A future? Us?"

"That's not what I meant—"

"Then what did you mean?" His hands dropped from my shoulders, hurt creeping into his expression. "Because lately, Ruthie, I don't understand you at all. You've been different. Distant."

"I've been working," I said weakly.

"It's more than that." Tommy ran a hand through his hair. "You're somewhere else even when you're here. You don't laugh anymore. You barely kiss me goodnight. And now you're talking about college like our plans don't matter."

"Maybe I'm figuring out what I want my plans to be."

"Your plans?" Tommy's voice rose. "What about our plans? We've been together for two years. Everyone knows we're getting married. Your parents, my parents, the whole damn town."

"Maybe that's the problem!" The words burst out before I could stop them. "Maybe I'm tired of everyone knowing what I'm going to do before I decide for myself!"

Tommy stared at me, genuinely shocked. We'd never fought like this before. I'd always been agreeable, sweet, the good girlfriend who went along with his ideas and smiled at his jokes.

"Where is this coming from?" he asked, his voice quieter now, wary.

"It's coming from me," I said. "I'm seventeen, Tommy. I'm not ready to plan out the rest of my life."

"But you were ready last month. Last week, even. What changed?" His eyes narrowed slightly, and I saw the exact moment suspicion crept in. "Is there someone else?"

My heart stuttered. "No."

The lie tasted bitter.

"Are you sure? Because you've been acting strange ever since..." He trailed off, thinking. "Ever since that guy on the motorcycle started coming around the diner."

"This has nothing to do with Jack," I said, too quickly, too defensively.

"Jack." Tommy repeated the name like it tasted bad. "So you know his name."

"He's a customer. Of course I know his name."

"A customer you know by name. A customer everyone says you've been seen with." Tommy's face was hardening, hurt transforming into anger. "Mrs. Patterson told my mother she saw you on the pier late one night with some boy on a motorcycle. I told her she was wrong, that my girlfriend wouldn't sneak around behind my back. Was I wrong, Ruthie?"

The question hung between us like a challenge. I could lie again, double down, protect my secret. But suddenly I was tired of lying. Tired of pretending. Tired of being the good girl who never caused trouble.

"I've been talking to him," I admitted. "That's all. Just talking."

"Just talking." Tommy's laugh was bitter. "At night. On the pier. Behind my back."

"You don't understand—"

"You're right, I don't understand!" Tommy's voice cracked. "I don't understand how the girl I love, the girl I'm planning a future with, is sneaking around with some drifter. I don't understand what he has that I don't. I've been faithful to you, Ruthie. I've been good to you. I've never even looked at another girl. And you—"

"I haven't done anything wrong," I said, but the words felt hollow.

"Haven't you?" Tommy's eyes were bright with unshed tears. "Sneaking out. Lying to me. To your parents. Making me look like a fool in front of the whole town. What do you call that?"

I didn't have an answer.

Tommy waited, and when I stayed silent, something in his expression broke. "Do you even love me?"

The question I'd been avoiding. The truth I hadn't wanted to face.

"I don't know," I whispered.

It was the most honest thing I'd said all night, and it destroyed him. I watched the hope drain from Tommy's face, watched him transform from eager to devastated in the space of three words.

"You don't know," he repeated flatly.

"Tommy, I'm sorry. I'm confused and—"

"Does he love you?" Tommy asked. "This Jack person? Has he promised you anything? Or is he just using you for fun before he rides out of town?"

"It's not like that."

"Then what is it like, Ruthie? Because from where I'm standing, you're throwing away something real for... what? Some guy you barely know? Some fantasy that you'll escape Seaside Heights and become some famous writer?" His voice was cruel now, sharpened by hurt. "That's not how life works. That's not how the world works."

"Maybe that's how your world works," I shot back. "But I don't want to live in a world where I'm seventeen and everything's already decided."

"Fine." Tommy's jaw clenched. "Fine. You want to keep your options open? You want to figure out what you want? Do it without me."

"Tommy—"

"I'm taking you home." He was already walking back toward the parking lot, his shoulders rigid with hurt and anger.

I followed, tears blurring my vision. I'd handled this all wrong. I should have been clearer, should have broken up with him weeks ago, should have been honest instead of letting him build dreams on a foundation I was already destroying.

The drive home was silent and terrible. Tommy's hands gripped the steering wheel so tight his knuckles were white. I stared out the window, tears sliding down my cheeks, hating myself for hurting him and hating myself more for feeling relieved.

When he pulled up in front of my house, he didn't turn off the engine.

"Tommy," I started, not sure what I was going to say.

"Don't." His voice was rough. "Just... don't."

I got out of the car slowly, hoping he'd say something else, hoping he'd look at me. But he kept his eyes forward, waiting for me to close the door so he could drive away.

"I'm sorry," I whispered.

"Yeah," he said. "Me too."

He pulled away the moment I shut the door, tires kicking up gravel. I stood in my driveway watching his taillights disappear around the corner, my chest aching with guilt and grief and something else.

Relief.

Terrible, shameful relief that I didn't have to pretend anymore, didn't have to smile at house plans and wedding timelines. That I didn't have to spend the rest of my life being the girl Tommy Richardson wanted me to be.

I walked inside slowly, knowing my parents would ask about the movie, would notice I was home early. I'd have to lie again, or start telling truths I wasn't ready to speak.

In my room, I pulled out my journal and stared at the blank page. But no words came. Just the image of Tommy's devastated face, the sound of his voice cracking when he asked if I loved him.

And underneath the guilt, quiet but insistent: the knowledge that the good girl I'd been was gone. Whoever I was becoming—whoever I really was—she didn't fit in Tommy's perfect house with the white shutters.

She didn't fit in Seaside Heights at all.
