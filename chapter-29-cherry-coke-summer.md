# Chapter 29: Facing Forward Together

The diner was busy with the Monday morning crowd—businessmen grabbing coffee before work, construction crews ordering breakfast platters, regulars reading their newspapers at the counter. The bell above the door chimed as Jack and I walked in, hand in hand.

Every conversation stopped.

I felt the weight of their stares—curious, judgmental, shocked. I saw Mrs. Patterson's eyes widen. Mr. Chen looked up from his eggs. Even Diane, wiping down a table near the window, froze mid-motion.

But I didn't let go of Jack's hand. I held it tighter.

My mother was behind the counter, pouring coffee for old Mr. Murphy. She looked up at the sudden silence, and when she saw us—saw me three hours late for my shift, holding hands with the boy she'd forbidden me to see—her face went pale, then red.

"Ruthie Ann Davis." Her voice was quiet, but it carried through the silent diner. "What do you think you're doing?"

My father emerged from the kitchen, spatula still in hand. He took one look at us and his jaw clenched.

"We need to talk," I said, my voice steadier than I felt. "Please. Can we talk?"

"You were supposed to be at work three hours ago," my mother said tightly. "You climbed out your window—again—and now you waltz in here holding his hand like you haven't been lying to us for weeks?"

"I know." I felt Jack's hand tense in mine, but I didn't let go. "I know you're angry. You have every right to be. But I need you to listen. Really listen."

"I think we've heard enough," my father said.

"No." The word came out firm. "You've told me what you think. You've told me what you want for me. But you haven't listened to what I want. And I need you to hear me."

Mr. Henderson appeared from his usual corner booth, his kind face concerned. "Rita, Frank—why don't we take this to the back office? Give the kids some privacy."

"This doesn't concern you, Bill," my father said sharply.

"Actually, it does." Mr. Henderson's voice was gentle but firm. "Ruthie's been one of my best students. And I think she deserves to be heard."

My mother looked like she wanted to argue, but the entire diner was watching. She couldn't have this fight in front of everyone without making it worse.

"Fine." She set down the coffee pot with more force than necessary. "Back office. Now."

The four of us walked through the diner—me and Jack, my parents behind us—while everyone pretended not to stare. I felt exposed, vulnerable. But I also felt Jack beside me, steady and real.

The back office was small and cramped, smelling of old paper and coffee grounds. My father closed the door, and suddenly the space felt even smaller.

"Well?" My mother crossed her arms. "What could you possibly have to say that justifies this—this performance?"

"It's not a performance," I said quietly. "That's the whole point. I'm done performing."

"Don't get smart—"

"I'm not being smart. I'm being honest." I took a breath, gathering my courage. "I'm applying to colleges in California. San Francisco State and UCLA. For journalism. Mr. Henderson is helping with applications and recommendation letters."

My father's face darkened. "We've already discussed this—"

"You discussed it," I interrupted gently. "You told me what you wanted. But you didn't ask me. And I need you to understand—I can't inherit the diner. I can't stay in Seaside Heights forever. It would kill something in me. Something essential."

"That's dramatic," my mother said, but her voice wavered.

"It's true." I met her eyes. "You raised me to be independent and smart. You encouraged me to excel in school. You were proud when I got good grades. But now that those things are leading me somewhere other than where you want me—you're angry."

"We want you safe," my father said gruffly. "We want you to have a good life."

"I know. But your version of a good life isn't mine." I squeezed Jack's hand, drawing strength from him. "I love you both. So much. But I need to choose my own path, even if it's not the one you'd choose for me."

My mother's eyes were bright with unshed tears. "And him?" She gestured at Jack. "He's part of this path?"

"Yes." I said it firmly, clearly. "Jack is staying in Seaside Heights. He has a permanent job at Murphy's Garage. He's taking night classes to get his GED, maybe study automotive technology or business. He's building a life here."

"A dropout working at a garage," my father muttered. "That's who you're choosing over Tommy?"

"I'm not choosing him over Tommy." The distinction mattered. "I already chose not to marry Tommy, before Jack was even really in the picture. Tommy wanted me to be his wife, to live in that house on Maple Street, to never leave. And I couldn't do that. Not for Tommy, not for anyone."

"But you'll choose this—this drifter?" My mother's voice broke slightly.

"He's not a drifter anymore," I said. "He's staying. And yes, I choose him. Not instead of my dreams—alongside them. He encourages me to go to college. He supports my journalism ambitions. He wants me to grow, not shrink."

Jack had been silent through all of this, but now he spoke, his voice quiet but steady. "Mr. and Mrs. Davis, I know you don't think much of me. I understand why. But I want you to know—I love your daughter. And part of loving her means wanting what's best for her, even when that's hard for me."

My father studied him. "What's that supposed to mean?"

"It means I'm staying in Seaside Heights while she goes to California," Jack said. "Because that's her dream, and I won't ask her to give that up for me. It means we'll do long-distance—letters and phone calls and visits when we can afford them. It means supporting her even when I wish she could stay."

My mother's expression softened slightly, but she still looked skeptical. "And when she meets some college boy? Someone with her education and ambitions?"

"Then she'll have to choose," Jack said simply. "And whatever she chooses, I'll respect it. Because that's what love is—trusting someone enough to let them grow, even if they grow away from you."

The office was silent for a long moment. I could hear the diner sounds through the thin walls—the clatter of plates, the murmur of conversation, the hiss of the coffee maker.

Finally, my father sighed. "You really want this? College in California?"

"Yes."

"And you think you can make it work? The distance?"

"I don't know," I admitted. "But I want to try. And I need you to support that, even if you don't understand it."

My mother wiped her eyes. "You're still grounded. For the sneaking out, for the lying. Two more weeks."

"Okay." It was fair. "I can accept that."

"And you—" she pointed at Jack, "—you're going to have to prove yourself. Show us you're serious about staying, about building something real."

"Yes, ma'am," Jack said.

"And if you hurt her—"

"I know," he said quietly. "But I'm going to try not to."

My father ran a hand through his hair, looking tired and older than I'd ever seen him. "I don't like this. Any of it. But I can see you've made up your mind."

"I have."

"You get that stubborn streak from your mother," he muttered, and despite everything, my mother almost smiled.

"We're not giving you our blessing," she said firmly. "Not yet. Maybe not ever. But we're not kicking you out either. You're still our daughter. Even when you're making choices we don't agree with."

It wasn't acceptance. But it was something. A crack in the wall, a possibility of eventual understanding.

"Thank you," I whispered.

"Don't thank me yet," my mother said. "You're still working your shifts, still saving money for college. And no more sneaking out. If you're seeing him—" she nodded at Jack, "—you do it honestly. No more lies."

"No more lies," I agreed.

We walked out of the office together, back into the diner. The breakfast crowd had thinned slightly, but plenty of people remained—including Diane, who was blatantly eavesdropping near the office door.

My mother handed me an apron. "Your shift started three hours ago. You can make up the time tonight."

"Yes, ma'am."

Jack squeezed my hand one more time before letting go. "I should get to the garage. Mr. Murphy's expecting me."

"Okay."

He leaned in, kissed my cheek—soft and quick, but deliberate. Public. A statement to everyone watching that we weren't hiding anymore.

"I'll see you later?" he asked.

"Tonight. After my shift."

"I'll be at the pier."

"I know."

He walked out, the bell chiming behind him, and I tied on my apron. The diner felt different somehow—like I was seeing it with new eyes. It was still my family's place, still familiar and comfortable. But it wasn't my future anymore. It was my present, my here and now, but not my forever.

And that was okay.

I poured coffee for Mr. Murphy, who gave me a knowing look. "That boy's a good worker. Reliable. Got a good head on his shoulders."

"Thank you," I said quietly.

"You fight for what you want, girl," he said. "Life's too short for regrets."

I nodded, feeling the truth of it settle in my chest.

Diane approached the counter, her expression uncertain. "So you're really doing this? College and everything?"

"I'm really doing this."

"Even though everyone's talking about you?"

"Especially then," I said. "Besides, they were already talking about me. Might as well give them something real to talk about."

Diane smiled, tentative but genuine. "You're braver than I am."

"Maybe," I said. "Or maybe I'm just tired of being afraid."

The rest of my shift passed in a blur of orders and coffee refills and curious glances. But I held my head high. I'd claimed my truth in front of my parents, in front of the town. I'd walked in holding Jack's hand, and I'd walked out knowing I was choosing my own path.

It wasn't perfect. My parents were still hurt, still skeptical. The town was still judging. Tommy was still somewhere nursing his wounded pride. But I was honest. I was real.

And that felt like victory.

When my shift finally ended at 2 PM, I untied my apron and grabbed my journal. The pier was calling—our place, where everything had started to change.

Jack was waiting.

And we had a future to plan.
