# Chapter 24: Ruthie's Declaration

The morning sun was warm. Below us, waves rolled in eternal rhythm. Jack stood tense, his body tight with the effort of not running.

I'd never felt more powerful.

"Everyone has been telling me what I want," I began, voice steady despite my racing heart. "My parents want me to take over the diner, marry Tommy, never leave. Tommy wanted his wife in that house on Maple Street. The town wanted the good girl who never caused trouble."

Jack's hands gripped the railing tighter, but he stayed silent.

"Even you, Jack. Last night, you told me you know what's best for me. You decided that leaving would fix everything, that I'd be better off without you. You made that choice for both of us without asking me what I actually want."

"Because what you want doesn't matter if it destroys your life—"

"My life," I interrupted firmly. "Not yours. Mine. And I get to decide what destroys it and what saves it. Not you. Not my parents. Not Tommy or the town or anyone else. Me."

The word hung in the air between us, solid and unshakable.

"Do you know what it's like?" I stepped closer. "To spend seventeen years being who everyone expects? I was so busy being what everyone wanted that I forgot who I actually was."

"Ruthie—"

"I'm not finished." My voice strengthened. "You say I've lost everything—my reputation, my parents' approval, Tommy, the town's respect. You're right. All of that's true."

Jack's expression cracked, pain flooding through.

"But you're wrong about what it means," I said. "I didn't lose those things because of you. I lost them because I finally told the truth about what I wanted. Because I finally chose myself."

"Choosing yourself shouldn't mean losing everything else—"

"Shouldn't it?" I laughed, giddy with clarity. "If keeping everything means lying about who I am—then what am I keeping? A life that requires me to disappear?"

Jack stared at me like he'd never seen me before.

"I stood on that bandstand with Tommy on one knee," I said. "The entire town watching, waiting for yes. Everyone ready for the fairy tale ending."

"And you said no," Jack said quietly.

"I said no." I moved closer, until I was right beside him, both of us looking out at the endless ocean. "Not because you were in the picture. You weren't even at that picnic. I said no because in that moment, I saw my entire future stretched out before me, and it looked like a prison. A comfortable, safe, respectable prison. But a prison all the same."

"So you chose uncertainty instead. You chose chaos and judgment and your parents' fury—"

"I chose honesty," I corrected. "I chose to stop pretending. I chose to admit that I have dreams bigger than Seaside Heights, ambitions beyond being someone's wife and someone's daughter. I chose to believe that wanting more doesn't make me selfish or ungrateful or wrong."

Jack turned to face me fully. "And where did that choice get you?"

"It got me here." I met his eyes. "Standing on this pier, telling the truth to someone who actually sees me. Someone who encouraged me to want more instead of teaching me to want less. Someone who made me feel like my dreams mattered."

"Ruthie, I can't be the reason you throw your life away—"

"You're not!" The words came out fierce, passionate. "God, Jack, why can't you understand? You didn't make me want to go to college—I always wanted that. You didn't make me question my future with Tommy—I was already questioning it. You didn't create my dreams of being a journalist and seeing the world. Those were mine before I ever met you."

"Then what did I do?"

"You saw them," I said simply. "Everyone else saw who they needed me to be. You saw who I actually was. The girl who wanted more, felt trapped, dreamed of elsewhere. And instead of trying to make her smaller—you told her she was right."

Jack's expression was anguished. "And your life fell apart."

"My old life fell apart. The one I was performing." I stepped closer. "Yes, it's painful. Yes, I'm dealing with consequences. But it's real. I'm actually living instead of performing. Choosing myself even when it costs me."

Jack shook his head. "You're seventeen. You shouldn't have to choose between your family and your dreams—"

"But I do have to choose. That's the truth you're helping me avoid by leaving." I grabbed his hands, forcing him to feel the conviction in my touch. "My parents want me to stay small. They want me to inherit the diner and never leave Seaside Heights. They want me safe and contained and exactly who I've always been. And I love them—I do—but I can't live the life they want for me."

"So what do you want?" The question came out raw, desperate.

"I want to go to college." The words came easy now, each one like shedding weight. "I want to study journalism at San Francisco State or UCLA. I want to write about real people and real stories. I want to experience things and meet people and figure out who I am away from everyone's expectations."

"Then do it," Jack said. "Apply to colleges. Go. Live your dream—"

"I'm not finished," I said firmly. "I want those things. I want them so badly it aches. But I also want you."

Jack flinched like I'd hit him.

"I want you," I repeated, stronger now. "Not because you're safe or convenient or approved by my parents. Not because you're my rebellion or my escape route. I want you because when I'm with you, I feel like myself. Because you see me clearly and encourage me to grow. Because you're brave enough to be honest even when honesty is hard."

"I'm leaving, Ruthie. I can't stay—"

"I'm not asking you to stay for me." The distinction was crucial. "I'm not asking you to sacrifice what you need so I can have what I want. I'm just telling you the truth before you go."

"What truth?"

"That you matter," I said, my voice breaking slightly. "That these past weeks with you mattered. That you didn't ruin me or poison me or destroy my future. You helped me find my courage. You helped me see that choosing myself isn't selfish—it's necessary."

Jack was trembling now, his walls cracking. "But I'm still leaving."

"I know." And God, that hurt. "I know you're too scared to stay. I know you believe you're not worth fighting for, that everyone you care about is better off without you. I know your wounds run so deep that love feels like threat instead of promise."

"So why are you here?" His voice broke completely. "Why did you run six blocks to find me if you know I'm leaving anyway?"

"Because you need to know the truth." I squeezed his hands. "You're not poison. You're not cursed. You're just hurt, and you learned to run before you could be abandoned."

Tears ran down my face.

"I was suffocating, performing instead of being real. We found each other when we both needed to be seen. That's not tragedy. That's grace."

"It doesn't feel like grace." His voice was wrecked. "It feels like I'm destroying you."

"You're not destroying me. You're leaving me. There's a difference." I let go of his hands, stepped back. "And that's your choice to make. I can't force you to stay. I can't make you believe you're worthy of being loved. I can't fix the wounds your mother left or save you from your own fear."

"Then why are you here?"

"To tell you the truth." I wiped my eyes, straightened my shoulders. "The truth is, I'm going to be okay. I'm going to apply to those colleges. I'm going to fight for my dreams even if my parents never forgive me. I'm going to build the life I want, even if it's harder and scarier than the one everyone wanted for me."

"Good," Jack managed. "That's good."

"But I'll miss you." The admission hurt. "I'll miss our conversations on this pier. I'll miss your motorcycle rides up the coast highway. I'll miss the way you see me—really see me—in a way no one else ever has."

Jack's face crumpled.

"I'll miss you," I repeated. "But I won't wait for you. I won't put my life on hold hoping you'll come back someday. I'm choosing myself, Jack. The way you taught me to."

"I didn't mean—"

"Yes, you did." I smiled through my tears. "You taught me that choosing myself is brave. That wanting more doesn't make me selfish. That living my truth matters more than keeping everyone else comfortable. So that's what I'm doing. I'm choosing me. My dreams. My future."

"Without me."

"Without you," I agreed. "Because you're choosing fear over us. And I understand why—I do—but I can't make that choice for you. I can only make my own."

We stood in silence, ocean rolling beneath us. This was goodbye. Real goodbye.

"Thank you," I said. "For seeing me. For encouraging my dreams. I'll carry that with me."

"Ruthie—"

"I hope you find peace. I hope you learn running doesn't heal wounds. I hope someday you're brave enough to stay." I took one last look—dark eyes, vulnerable expression, the boy who couldn't believe he deserved love. "But I'm not waiting. I'm moving forward."

"I know," he whispered. "You should."

"So this is goodbye."

"Yeah." His voice was barely audible. "Goodbye, Ruthie."

I kissed his cheek—gentle, final—then turned and walked away. Down the pier, away from the ocean, away from the boy who'd helped me find myself but couldn't stay to see who I became.

Every step hurt. But I kept walking.

Because that's what brave people did. They made the hard choices even when those choices broke their hearts. They chose themselves even when love asked them to shrink.

They walked away when staying would mean losing themselves.

I didn't look back. If I looked back, I'd see him standing there, and I'd run back, and I'd beg, and that wouldn't change anything. He'd still be too afraid to stay. And I'd still be choosing myself.

So I kept walking. Past the boardwalk, past the diner where I should have been working, past the boundaries of my old, small life.

Toward something new. Something uncertain. Something mine.

Behind me, I heard an engine roar to life. The motorcycle. Jack, riding away north toward whatever came next for him.

The sound faded into the distance, and then there was just the ocean and the morning birds and the beating of my own brave heart.

I'd told him the truth. I'd claimed my voice. I'd chosen myself.

And somehow, even with tears streaming down my face and my heart breaking, that felt like victory.
