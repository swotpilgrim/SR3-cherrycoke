# Chapter 19: Parental Fury

I knew the confrontation was coming. It had been building since the picnic, simmering beneath cold silence and carefully neutral expressions. For three days, we'd existed in uneasy tension, speaking only when necessary.

Monday night, when I came home from the hardware store with red eyes and exhausted heart, I found both my parents waiting in the living room like a tribunal.

"Sit down, Ruthie." My father's voice was controlled, but I heard the anger underneath.

I sat on the edge of the armchair, feeling like a defendant facing judgment.

"We need to talk about what happened at the picnic," my mother began. Her eyes were puffy from crying, her hands twisted together in her lap. "And more importantly, we need to talk about why it happened."

"I already explained—"

"You've explained nothing!" My mother's composure cracked. "You humiliated Tommy in front of the entire town. You embarrassed our family. And for what? Some foolish notion about college?"

"It's not foolish. It's what I want."

"What you want," my father repeated, his tone making it sound like a flaw. "What about the years we've spent building this business for you? Planning your future?"

"I appreciate that—"

"Do you?" He leaned forward. "Because it looks like you're throwing it back in our faces. We built Pop's Diner to pass down to you. A family legacy."

"I never asked for that." The words came out more forcefully than I intended. "You decided my future without asking what I wanted."

"Because we're your parents!" My mother's voice rose. "It's our job to guide you, to protect you from making mistakes. And this—" she gestured helplessly, "—this is a mistake, Ruthie. A huge one."

"Choosing college is a mistake? Wanting to be a journalist is a mistake?"

"Throwing away certainty for a dream is a mistake," my father said flatly. "Dreams don't pay bills. But Tommy offered you stability, a home, a real future."

"A future I don't want," I said. "I'm seventeen. I'm not ready to get married. I want to learn things, experience things—"

"You can do that here," my mother interrupted. "There's nothing wrong with our town. Why isn't it good enough?"

"It's not about good enough! It's about different."

"Different like that boy on the motorcycle?" My father's eyes narrowed. "Is that what this is really about? You've been sneaking around with Jack Malone, haven't you?"

The accusation hung in the air. I could lie, could deflect. But I was so tired of lying.

"Yes," I said. "I've been seeing Jack."

My mother made a wounded sound. My father's face darkened with rage.

"A drifter," he said, his voice tight. "A nobody who showed up here a few weeks ago with nothing but a motorcycle and a leather jacket. That's who you chose over Tommy Richardson?"

"I didn't choose Jack over Tommy. I chose myself over a life that would have made me miserable."

"Miserable?" My mother looked genuinely baffled. "How would being married to a kind, hardworking boy who loves you make you miserable?"

"Because I don't love him!" The words burst out louder than I intended. "Not the way you should love someone you marry. I care about him, but Mom, I can't spend my whole life with someone just because he's nice and everyone approves. That's not enough."

"Love isn't everything," my father said. "Compatibility. Shared values. Common goals. Those matter more than some romantic notion of passion."

"We don't have those things either! Tommy wants to stay in Seaside Heights forever. He wants to run the hardware store and never leave. I want to go to college, study journalism, see what's out there. We want completely different lives."

"You're seventeen," my mother said. "You don't know what you want. These are just childish dreams that you'll outgrow."

"Stop calling them childish!" My frustration boiled over. "Mr. Henderson doesn't think they're childish. He thinks I have real talent. He's offered to help me apply to journalism schools."

"Mr. Henderson is a retired old man who's filling your head with nonsense," my father snapped. "He doesn't have to live with the consequences of your choices. We do."

"The consequences of my choices?" I stood up, unable to sit still anymore. "Or the consequences of me not following your plan? Because that's what this is really about, isn't it? You had everything mapped out—I'd date Tommy, work at the diner, marry him, take over the business. You decided my entire life without asking me what I wanted."

"We're trying to protect you from making a mistake that will ruin your future!" my mother cried.

"What future? The one where I'm trapped in this town doing a job I don't love, married to a man I care about but don't love, waking up at forty and wondering what might have been if I'd just been brave enough to try?" I was crying now, the words pouring out. "That's the mistake, Mom. Staying here when every fiber of my being is screaming to go would be the mistake."

"And I suppose Jack Malone is encouraging all of this?" My father's voice dripped with contempt. "Telling you to follow your dreams, to leave your family, to throw away everything for him?"

"Jack is the only person who's actually listened to what I want!" I shot back. "He's encouraged me to apply to colleges even though it means we'll be apart. He's told me my dreams matter. He's treated me like I have value beyond being someone's daughter or girlfriend or wife."

"He's using you," my father said flatly. "Boys like that, they're good at saying what girls want to hear. But when it comes down to it, he'll leave you high and dry. Mark my words."

"You don't know him."

"I know his type. Troubled background, no roots, always moving on. You think he's going to stay in Seaside Heights for you? You think this is real?" My father stood, towering over me. "He'll be gone in a month, Ruthie, and you'll be left with nothing. No Tommy, no future, no reputation. Just regrets."

"At least they'll be my regrets," I said. "My choices. My life."

"Not while you're living under our roof." My father's voice went cold and final. "I've tried to be reasonable. I've tried to understand. But clearly you're not capable of making good decisions right now. So we're making them for you."

My stomach dropped. "What do you mean?"

"You're grounded," he said. "Effective immediately. You'll come straight home after your shifts at the diner—where your mother or I will supervise you. No going out with friends. No evening walks. And absolutely no contact with Jack Malone."

"Dad, you can't—"

"I can and I am. You're seventeen years old and you're acting like a child. So we're treating you like one until you show some sense."

"Ben, maybe that's too harsh—" my mother started, but my father cut her off.

"Carol, she's out of control. She's thrown away a good boy, embarrassed our family, and is running around with some troublemaker. She needs structure. She needs boundaries."

"I need you to trust me!" I was fully crying now, anger and hurt warring for dominance. "I need you to believe I can make my own decisions. I need you to support me instead of trying to force me into the life you want!"

"Support you in making mistakes?" My father's laugh was bitter. "That's not parenting. That's negligence."

"Wanting to go to college isn't a mistake!"

"Wanting to go is one thing. Throwing away everything you have—your boyfriend, your reputation, your future with the family business—that's a mistake. And I won't stand by and watch you destroy your life."

"You're not trying to save my life," I said through tears. "You're trying to control it."

"Same thing when you're too young and foolish to know what's good for you."

I looked at my mother, desperate for an ally. "Mom, please. You understand, don't you? About wanting more, about dreams?"

My mother's face was anguished, torn between sympathy and allegiance. "I understand being young and wanting things. But I also understand that sometimes the life we think we want isn't the life that will make us happy. I wanted to be a singer once. I dreamed of moving to Hollywood."

"I didn't know that."

"Because it didn't happen. I met your father, we got married, we built a life here. And I've been happy, Ruthie. Really, truly happy. The dreams I gave up—they were just dreams. This—" she gestured around at our house, our life, "—this is real."

"But what if I'm different?" I asked desperately. "What if I wouldn't be happy with the same choices? Doesn't that matter?"

"It matters," my mother said softly. "But so does protecting you from pain we've already lived through. The world isn't kind to girls who chase impractical dreams."

"So I should just give up? Just accept the safe path even if it kills something inside me?"

"You should be practical," my father interjected. "You should think with your head instead of your heart. And since you seem incapable of that right now, we're going to help you by removing temptation."

"You're removing my freedom."

"We're providing structure." His tone made it clear the discussion was over. "You're grounded until further notice. No Jack, no late nights, no nonsense. You work, you come home, you think about what you've done. Maybe when you've calmed down and started thinking clearly, we can revisit this. But until then, our house, our rules."

I stood there shaking, feeling the walls closing in around me. They didn't understand. They didn't want to understand. They wanted the daughter who fit neatly into their plans, not the one I actually was.

"This won't change how I feel," I said quietly.

"We'll see." My father dismissed me with a gesture. "Go to your room. We'll talk more when you're ready to be reasonable."

I walked upstairs on unsteady legs, feeling like a prisoner. From my window, the world beyond felt impossibly far away.

They'd grounded me. Forbidden me from seeing Jack. Decided that control was better than trust, that their fear for my future was more important than my right to choose it.

I pulled out my journal and wrote: "They think they're protecting me. But you can't protect someone by clipping their wings and calling it love."

Three days until my next evening shift when I might be able to see Jack. Three days of this prison.

But I'd survived worse. I'd survived the public proposal, the town's judgment, breaking up with Tommy.

I'd survive this too.

And somehow, some way, I'd find a way to choose myself. Even if it meant disappointing everyone I loved.

Especially then.
