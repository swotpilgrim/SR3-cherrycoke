# BIBLE: Cherry Coke Summer

## Story Premise

Seventeen-year-old Ruthie Davis serves Cherry Cokes at Pop's Beach Diner in Seaside Heights, California, dreaming of escaping to college and a journalism career while everyone expects her to marry her safe boyfriend Tommy and stay local. When brooding motorcycle rider Jack Malone becomes a regular at the diner, Ruthie is drawn to his mysterious intensity and the freedom he represents. As their secret connection deepens, Ruthie must choose between the safe path laid out for her and the risk of following her own dreams—even if it means losing everything she's known.

## Protagonist: Ruthie Davis

**Age:** 17

**Background:** Ruthie has lived in Seaside Heights her entire life, the only child of Ben and Carol Davis who own Pop's Beach Diner. She's worked at the diner since age fourteen, initially bussing tables, now waitressing full-time every summer. Her parents expect her to attend the local community college, marry Tommy Richardson (her boyfriend since sophomore year), and eventually take over the family business. Ruthie loves her parents but feels suffocated by their narrow vision for her future.

**Personality:** Ruthie is observant, introspective, and quietly ambitious. She's the "good girl" everyone expects her to be—polite, reliable, dutiful—but underneath she's restless and hungry for experiences beyond the diner counter. She writes in a journal every night, filling pages with observations about customers, town life, and dreams of the wider world. She's naturally empathetic and sees people clearly, which makes her both a good waitress and a budding journalist. Though she appears content on the surface, she's slowly suffocating under the weight of everyone's expectations.

**Goal:** Ruthie wants to escape Seaside Heights for college, study journalism, and write about the real world beyond her small coastal town. She dreams of living in a city, meeting people with different stories, and making something of herself on her own terms.

**Fear/Obstacle:** Ruthie fears disappointing her parents and losing the security of her predictable life, but she's even more afraid of waking up at forty still serving Cherry Cokes and wondering what might have been.

**Arc:** Ruthie begins the story trapped between duty and desire, performing the role of dutiful daughter and girlfriend while secretly yearning for more. Through her relationship with Jack and the crisis it precipitates, she learns that choosing herself isn't selfish—it's necessary. By the end, she claims her own dreams with courage, understanding that real love supports her truth rather than asking her to diminish it.

## Love Interest: Jack Malone

**Age:** 18

**Background:** Jack arrived in Seaside Heights three weeks before the story begins, riding a motorcycle and carrying everything he owns in a duffel bag. He's running from a troubled home situation in Nevada—an alcoholic father and a mother who left when he was twelve. He's been on his own since dropping out of high school at seventeen, working odd jobs and moving from town to town. Seaside Heights is supposed to be just another stop, but something about the ocean and the small-town peace makes him linger.

**Personality:** Jack is quiet, watchful, and guarded, with an intensity that comes from surviving too much too young. He doesn't trust easily and keeps people at arm's length, but underneath his tough exterior is a thoughtful soul who reads books from thrift stores and notices small kindnesses. He's been judged his whole life for how he looks and where he comes from, which has made him both defensive and deeply lonely. With Ruthie, he reveals glimpses of tenderness and intelligence that surprise her—and surprise him too.

**Initial Barrier:** Jack represents everything Ruthie's parents warn against—the dangerous outsider, the boy with no roots, the "trouble" on a motorcycle. His leather jacket, his silence, and his mysterious past make him seem threatening and unattainable to a good girl like Ruthie.

**Hidden Depth:** Beneath the bad-boy exterior, Jack is thoughtful, self-aware, and surprisingly encouraging of Ruthie's dreams. He's read more books than most people in town, thinks deeply about life and choices, and genuinely wants Ruthie to have the future she deserves—even if it doesn't include him.

**Arc:** Jack begins believing he's poison to anyone who cares about him, destined to hurt people just by being himself. Through loving Ruthie, he learns he's worthy of good things and capable of supporting someone without dragging them down. He discovers that staying somewhere and building something real is braver than running.

## Supporting Cast

### Tommy Richardson - The Safe Boyfriend

Tommy is seventeen, captain of the baseball team, and exactly the kind of boy parents approve of—polite, clean-cut, reliable, destined to work at his father's hardware store. He's dated Ruthie since sophomore year and genuinely loves her, but in an uncomplicated, unquestioning way. He assumes they'll marry after high school, settle in Seaside Heights, and live the same life their parents have lived. Tommy isn't cruel or controlling; he simply cannot imagine wanting anything different than what they have. When Ruthie pulls away, he's hurt and baffled, which makes him both sympathetic and an obstacle. His public proposal at the town picnic forces Ruthie's crisis point.

### Carol Davis - Ruthie's Mother

Carol, forty-two, has worked at Pop's Diner since she married Ben at nineteen. She's warm, practical, and genuinely happy with her life, which makes it hard for Ruthie to explain why the same life terrifies her. Carol sees Ruthie's restlessness as typical teenage wanderlust that she'll outgrow. She's protective, loving, and completely certain that Ruthie's dreams of journalism and college are impractical fantasies. Carol believes she's protecting Ruthie from disappointment by encouraging her to accept reality. She's a caring antagonist who thinks she's doing the right thing.

### Ben Davis - Ruthie's Father

Ben, forty-five, is a quiet, steady man who built Pop's Diner from nothing and takes pride in providing for his family. He's less vocal than Carol but equally invested in Ruthie taking over the business. Ben notices Ruthie's interest in Jack before Carol does and explicitly warns her away from "boys like that," drawing on his own past experience with a troubled older brother. He's stricter than Carol and sees Jack as a genuine threat to Ruthie's future. His disapproval carries weight because Ruthie rarely defies him.

### Diane Patterson - Best Friend and Fellow Waitress

Diane, seventeen, has been Ruthie's best friend since elementary school and works weekend shifts at the diner. She's more outgoing than Ruthie, boy-crazy in an innocent 1950s way, and dreams of marrying rich rather than leaving town. Diane is loyal but also thrives on gossip and drama. She's initially excited about Ruthie's secret romance with Jack, treating it like a movie plot, but becomes genuinely worried when the town turns against Ruthie. She serves as both confidante and voice of conventional wisdom, ultimately supporting Ruthie even when she doesn't understand her choices.

### Rita Kowalski - Head Waitress

Rita is fifty-something, has worked at Pop's since it opened, and functions as the diner's heart and gossip central. She's seen it all, has opinions about everything, and isn't shy about sharing them. Rita notices Jack's interest in Ruthie immediately and tries to protect her with warnings about men who ride through town on motorcycles and break hearts. She's sharp-tongued but deeply fond of Ruthie. Rita represents the voice of cautious experience—she's not wrong that Jack could hurt Ruthie, but she can't see past his surface to who he really is.

### Mr. Henderson - Diner Regular and Journalism Mentor

Mr. Henderson, sixty-eight, is a retired newspaper editor from San Francisco who summers in Seaside Heights. He's a daily breakfast regular who befriends Ruthie after noticing her journal and asking what she writes. He becomes an informal mentor, encouraging her journalism aspirations and helping her see that ambition isn't selfish. Mr. Henderson serves as the voice of possibility and validation, representing the larger world Ruthie dreams of joining. He's the one adult who truly understands why she needs to leave.

## Setting: Seaside Heights, California

**Time:** Summer 1957

**Key Locations:**

- **Pop's Beach Diner**: The heart of the story, a classic chrome-and-vinyl diner one block from the beach. Red leather booths, black-and-white checkered floor, long counter with spinning stools, jukebox in the corner. The counter is Ruthie's domain and where Jack always sits. The diner smells like coffee, bacon grease, and cherry syrup.

- **The Pier**: A weathered wooden pier extending into the Pacific, with a few fishing spots and a view of the sunset. This becomes Ruthie and Jack's meeting place for late-night conversations away from prying eyes. The pier represents freedom and honest conversation.

- **The Coast Highway**: The winding road north along the cliffs, where Jack takes Ruthie on midnight motorcycle rides. Represents escape, possibility, and the exhilaration of breaking free from constraints.

- **Richardson Hardware Store**: Where Tommy works with his father, representing the stable, predictable future Ruthie is expected to accept. Located on Main Street, center of town life and gossip.

**Period Details:** Summer of 1957 brings specific cultural context: Elvis is on the radio scandalizing parents, teenagers are caught between traditional values and emerging rock-and-roll rebellion, and the motorcycle (thanks to films like "The Wild One") carries specific dangerous connotations. Small-town California in this era means tight-knit communities where reputation matters enormously, especially for girls. Dating rules are strict, parental expectations are powerful, and a girl's future is largely defined by who she marries.

**Atmosphere:** Seaside Heights is picture-perfect summer Americana—tourists in swim trunks, local teens gathering at the diner after beach bonfires, sock hops at the community center. But beneath the cheerful surface is the claustrophobia of a small town where everyone knows everyone, gossip travels fast, and deviation from expected paths is noticed and judged. The ocean represents both the town's appeal and its limitations—beauty that reminds Ruthie there's a whole world beyond this strip of coast.

## Tone & Voice

First-person POV from Ruthie's perspective. Her narrative voice is observant and introspective, with the articulation of a girl who reads and writes but the authentic emotions of a seventeen-year-old experiencing first love and self-discovery. The tone balances wholesome 1950s innocence with genuine emotional depth—this isn't just nostalgic pastiche but a real coming-of-age story in period dress. Ruthie's voice includes period-appropriate details (she notices the specific red of Diane's lipstick, the chrome gleam of the diner counter, the way Jack's leather jacket smells like motorcycle oil and summer night) while remaining accessible to modern readers. The overall tone is earnest, romantic, and ultimately optimistic, with an undercurrent of yearning and the bittersweet recognition that growing up means choosing change even when it's painful.

## Theme

The central theme is claiming authentic selfhood versus performing expected roles. Ruthie must learn that being true to herself—pursuing her dreams, making unconventional choices, risking disapproval—isn't selfishness but necessary growth. The story explores the difference between love that asks you to shrink (Tommy's assumption she'll conform to his plans) and love that encourages you to grow (Jack's support of her dreams even when it might mean losing her). Secondary themes include the courage to disappoint people you love in service of your own truth, and the recognition that safety without authenticity is its own kind of trap.

## Romance Trope(s)

**Primary:** Bad boy/good girl dynamic—the leather-jacketed outsider and the dutiful diner waitress who shouldn't be together but find unexpected understanding. **Secondary:** Wrong side of the tracks/forbidden romance—Jack's mysterious, troubled background makes him forbidden fruit in Ruthie's small-town world, adding external obstacles to their connection. The romance pattern follows the classic structure of initial attraction despite warnings, growing emotional intimacy through secret meetings, crisis when their relationship threatens her reputation and future, and resolution when they commit to building something real on honest terms.
