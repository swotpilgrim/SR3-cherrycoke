# Chapter 17: Town Judgment

I don't know how long I sat on the pier before I heard footsteps on the wooden planks behind me. I tensed, expecting my mother or maybe Diane, but when I turned, it was Jack.

He sat down beside me without a word, his presence solid and reassuring. We stayed like that for a while, just sitting together while the sun sank lower and my tears finally dried on my cheeks.

"Someone at the garage told me what happened," Jack said quietly. "His wife was at the picnic."

"Everyone was at the picnic." My voice was hoarse from crying. "Everyone saw me humiliate Tommy in front of the whole town."

"You told the truth," Jack said. "That's not humiliation."

"Felt like it." I wiped my face with the back of my hand, probably smearing what was left of my carefully applied makeup. "I should have told him no privately. Before it got to this point. I should have been clearer."

"Maybe." Jack's arm came around my shoulders. "Or maybe he should have actually asked what you wanted instead of assuming he knew. But either way, it's done now. What matters is what you do next."

"I have no idea what I do next."

"Well, first, I take you home before your parents send out a search party. Then tomorrow, you face whatever comes. And I'll be there if you want me to be."

The offer made my throat tight. "You don't have to—"

"I want to." Jack turned me to face him. "Ruthie, I told you I'm staying. I meant it. That includes the hard parts. Especially the hard parts."

The ride home on Jack's motorcycle felt like traveling through enemy territory. I felt exposed. Judged. Marked.

Jack walked me to my door and squeezed my hand once. "I'll come by the diner tomorrow."

The house was dark. My parents weren't home yet—still dealing with the social fallout. I collapsed on my bed in the yellow dress that now felt like a costume from a play that had ended badly.

I woke to my parents coming home after ten, their voices carrying up—my mother's high and distressed, my father's low and angry.

I dreaded Sunday morning. Dreaded facing them, dreaded their disappointment, dreaded having to explain something I didn't fully understand myself. But when morning came, I couldn't hide in my room forever.

My mother was already at the diner when I arrived for my shift. Her face was drawn, her eyes red from crying, and she didn't speak to me except to give clipped instructions about which tables needed service.

The Sunday breakfast crowd was packed—but not because people were hungry. They came to stare. To whisper. To see the girl who'd said no.

Rita pulled me aside. "Today's going to be rough. People will say things. Keep your chin up, do your job, and don't let them see you break. Understand?"

I nodded, grateful for her gruff support.

The first hour was brutal. Customers who'd known me since childhood suddenly couldn't meet my eyes. Others stared openly. Mrs. Patterson, the town's most devoted gossip, sat in my section with her prayer circle friends, and their conversation was deliberately loud enough for me to hear.

"Such a sweet boy, Tommy is. Devastated, just devastated."

"In front of the whole town, too. How humiliating for him."

"I heard she's been sneaking around with that motorcycle fellow. The one with no family, no prospects."

"Well, that explains it. A girl's reputation, once tarnished..."

I refilled their coffee with shaking hands, my face burning. Rita caught my eye from across the diner and gave me a stern look that said: Don't you dare cry.

So I didn't. I swallowed the tears, kept my expression neutral, and moved on to the next table.

Mr. Henderson was my only source of comfort. He greeted me warmly, as if nothing had changed.

"How are you holding up, Miss Davis?"

"I've been better."

"I heard about yesterday. For what it's worth, I think you showed considerable courage."

"That's not what anyone else thinks."

"Small towns move on eventually." He smiled kindly. "And the people who matter will understand."

I wasn't sure I believed it, but it was nice to hear.

The worst moment came mid-morning when the Richardsons walked in. Tommy's parents, dressed in their church clothes, looking ten years older than they had yesterday. They didn't sit in my section—requested one of Diane's tables specifically—but I felt their cold stares like physical blows.

My mother seated them herself, murmuring apologies I couldn't hear but could easily imagine. When she came back behind the counter, she finally spoke to me directly.

"The Richardsons have been our friends for twenty years." Her voice was tight with suppressed emotion. "Do you have any idea what you've done to that relationship? To Tommy? To this family?"

"Mom, I couldn't marry him. I don't love him that way."

"Love isn't everything, Ruthie. Stability matters. Security matters. Respect matters." She was fighting tears. "And now instead of having a nice boy with a good future, you have a ruined reputation and the whole town talking about you."

"I'm sorry I embarrassed you," I said quietly. "But I'm not sorry I said no."

My mother looked at me like she didn't recognize me. "I don't know who you are anymore."

She walked away before I could respond, leaving me standing behind the counter with a full coffee pot and tears threatening to spill over.

Diane found me in the back room during my break.

"Hey," she said softly. "You okay?"

"Do I look okay?"

"You look like hell." But her tone was gentle. "The whole town's talking. Most think you're crazy, some brave, a few just mean."

"What do you think?"

"I think you did what you had to do. I don't understand it, but it's your life." She bumped my shoulder. "I'm still your friend."

The unconditional support, even wrapped in confusion, made me finally cry. Diane held me while I sobbed, rubbing my back and making soothing noises.

"It's going to get worse before it gets better," she warned when I'd cried myself out. "Tommy's really hurt. People are taking sides. And your parents... Ruthie, they're really upset."

"I know."

"But," Diane continued, "I also know you. And you don't do things without reasons. So there must be a good reason for this, even if I don't see it yet."

"I couldn't spend my life pretending to be someone I'm not," I said. "Even if that someone made everyone else happy."

"Well, you're definitely not pretending now." Diane managed a small smile. "Most talked-about person in town. Congratulations?"

Despite everything, I laughed. "Thanks. Exactly what I wanted."

The afternoon was more of the same. Whispers, stares, pointed silences. A few customers were openly supportive—Mr. Henderson's kind words, old Mrs. Chen who told me quietly that she'd run away from an arranged marriage fifty years ago and never regretted it. But most just judged.

I felt like I was wearing a scarlet letter. The Girl Who Said No. The Girl Who Broke Tommy Richardson's Heart. The Girl Who Chose Wrong.

When Jack came in at his usual time—two-thirty, like clockwork—the diner went silent. Every eye turned to watch him take his seat at my counter. The weight of their judgment was suffocating.

"Coffee," he said calmly, as if nothing had changed. "And whatever pie's good today."

My hands shook as I poured his cup. Rita was watching. My mother was watching. Half the diner was watching.

"Apple's fresh," I managed.

"Apple sounds perfect."

When I set down his pie, Jack caught my hand briefly. Just a moment of contact, his fingers warm against mine. "You're doing great," he said quietly. "Almost through."

I wanted to collapse into his arms. Wanted to run away again. Wanted to scream at everyone to mind their own business. Instead, I just nodded and went to refill Mrs. Patterson's coffee, feeling the weight of every stare.

By the time my shift ended at six, I was exhausted in a way that went beyond physical. Emotionally drained. Completely wrung out.

Jack was waiting outside, leaning against his motorcycle in the evening light.

"Want to get out of here?" he asked.

"God, yes."

We rode up the coast highway with the wind in our faces and the ocean beside us, and for the first time all day, I could breathe. When Jack pulled over at our favorite overlook, I practically fell off the bike, needing solid ground beneath my feet.

"That was the worst day of my life," I said, staring out at the darkening water.

"I believe it." Jack stood beside me. "For what it's worth, you handled it better than I would have."

"I cried in the back room and wanted to quit."

"But you didn't quit. You finished your shift with your head up. That takes strength."

I leaned against him, accepting the comfort of his presence. "It's going to be like this for a while, isn't it? The whispers and the judgment and everyone thinking I'm crazy or cruel or both."

"Probably," Jack said honestly. "Small towns don't forgive quickly. But they do eventually forgive. Or at least, they find something new to talk about."

"What if they don't? What if I'm marked forever as the girl who humiliated Tommy Richardson?"

"Then you leave for college and build a new life where nobody knows that story." Jack turned me to face him. "But I don't think it'll come to that. You'll be surprised how quickly today's scandal becomes tomorrow's old news."

"I hope you're right."

"Me too." He kissed my forehead gently. "But either way, you told the truth. You chose yourself. That matters more than what a bunch of gossiping townspeople think."

We stayed at the overlook until full dark, watching stars appear one by one. And slowly, the knot of anxiety in my chest began to loosen. The day had been awful. Tomorrow might be awful too. But I'd survived it.

I'd stood in front of the firing squad of public opinion and lived to tell the tale.

And Jack was right—I'd told the truth. Finally, publicly, undeniably, I'd told the truth about what I wanted.

Everything else, I'd figure out as I went.

When Jack took me home, I squared my shoulders before walking inside to face my parents. The conversation waiting for me wouldn't be pleasant. Nothing about the next few days would be pleasant.

But I was done performing. Done pretending. Done being the good girl who never caused trouble.

If Seaside Heights wanted to judge me, let them judge.

I knew who I was. And for the first time in my life, that felt like enough.
