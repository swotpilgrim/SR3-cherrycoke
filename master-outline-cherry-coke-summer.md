# MASTER OUTLINE: Cherry Coke Summer

## Chapter 1: The Counter Girl's Routine

Ruthie Davis wipes down the counter at Pop's Beach Diner on a blazing June morning, going through the familiar motions of her summer routine. She serves Cherry Cokes to tourists, refills coffee for regulars like Mr. Henderson, and listens to Rita gossip about town news. The jukebox plays Buddy Holly while Diane chatters about boys. Ruthie feels the weight of another summer exactly like the last, serving burgers and dreaming of elsewhere. Her parents discuss expansion plans for the diner, assuming Ruthie will be there to run it someday. During her break, Ruthie writes in her journal about feeling trapped in amber, watching life happen through the diner's plate-glass window. Mr. Henderson notices her writing and asks what she dreams about. She admits she wants to study journalism and leave Seaside Heights. He encourages her to apply to colleges. The chapter ends with Ruthie watching tourists drive away toward their real lives.

## Chapter 2: Tommy's Future Plans

After her shift, Ruthie meets Tommy Richardson at the beach. He's sweet and affectionate, talking excitedly about his father offering him a management position at the hardware store. Tommy assumes they'll marry after graduation, settle into a house near their parents, start a family. He paints a picture of their future that sounds exactly like everyone else's present. Ruthie tries to smile and nod but feels her chest tightening with panic. When Tommy mentions she could work part-time at the diner even after they have kids, Ruthie realizes he's never actually asked what she wants. She mentions college and journalism, but Tommy laughs it off as a phase, saying she'll outgrow such impractical ideas. They walk along the beach holding hands, but Ruthie feels miles away from him. The chapter ends with Tommy kissing her goodnight while Ruthie stares past him at the dark ocean, feeling suffocated.

## Chapter 3: The Stranger Arrives

A motorcycle roars into the diner's parking lot mid-afternoon, disrupting the sleepy summer rhythm. Jack Malone walks in wearing a leather jacket despite the heat, dark hair and darker eyes, carrying an air of danger that makes conversations stop. He sits at Ruthie's counter, orders coffee and apple pie in a low voice. The diner buzzes with curiosity—no one recognizes him. Rita whispers warnings about drifters and trouble. Diane practically vibrates with excitement, calling dibs on serving him tomorrow. But Jack's eyes follow Ruthie as she works, and she feels the weight of his attention even when her back is turned. When she refills his coffee, their hands nearly touch and she feels an electric jolt. He leaves a generous tip and a barely-there smile. After he leaves on his motorcycle, the diner explodes with speculation. Ruthie watches through the window as he disappears up the coast highway, feeling like something just shifted.

## Chapter 4: The Daily Regular

Jack returns the next day at the same time, taking the same counter seat. And the next day. And the day after. Within a week, he's become a fixture—coffee, pie, always at Ruthie's section, always watching her with those intense dark eyes. They barely speak beyond orders, but Ruthie finds herself hyperaware of him. She notices small things: the book in his jacket pocket, the careful way he handles his coffee cup, how he seems more relaxed each day. Other customers gossip openly about the mysterious stranger. Diane tries flirting with him once and gets polite disinterest. Rita mutters about bad news on a motorcycle. But Jack keeps coming back, and Ruthie catches herself hoping he will. One afternoon, as she sets down his pie, he quietly says, "You have kind eyes." It's the first personal thing he's said. Ruthie blushes and retreats, heart pounding.

## Chapter 5: Parental Warnings

Ruthie's parents notice Jack's daily presence at the counter. Over dinner, Ben brings it up carefully, mentioning "that motorcycle fellow" who's been around. Carol is more direct, warning Ruthie about men who drift through beach towns looking for trouble. Ben tells a story about his older brother who ran with the wrong crowd and ended up in prison. The message is clear: stay away from boys like Jack Malone. Ruthie insists she's just serving him coffee, but her mother's sharp eyes catch the defensive tone. The conversation shifts to Tommy—such a good boy, such a solid future. Ruthie's father mentions Tommy will make an excellent husband and provider. Later, lying in bed, Ruthie realizes her parents have mapped her entire life without asking if she wants the route they've chosen. She writes in her journal about feeling like a character in someone else's story.

## Chapter 6: First Real Conversation

During the lunch rush, Ruthie's swamped and stressed when she spills coffee on her order pad. Jack, sitting at the counter, calmly hands her a clean napkin and quietly talks her through a breathing moment while customers wait. His unexpected kindness disarms her. After the rush dies, he asks about the journal she sometimes writes in during breaks. Ruthie admits she wants to be a writer, a journalist maybe, see the world beyond Seaside Heights. For the first time, Jack really smiles—not his usual hint of expression but genuine warmth. He tells her that's a good dream, asks what she'd write about. They talk for ten minutes until Rita pointedly clears her throat. Ruthie realizes she's been leaning on the counter, completely absorbed in conversation. Jack leaves his usual generous tip, but this time also leaves a napkin with a recommendation: "Read John Steinbeck. He knew how to see people clearly."

## Chapter 7: The Midnight Ride Offer

Ruthie's closing shift ends at ten. She locks up the diner, tired and preoccupied with another argument with her mother about college applications. Jack is waiting in the parking lot, leaning against his motorcycle under the streetlight. He says he knows she closes at ten on Thursdays. Ruthie should be nervous—this is exactly what her parents warned against—but instead she feels a thrill of possibility. Jack asks if she wants to see the coast highway at night, promises to have her home by midnight, says she can say no and he'll leave her alone. Ruthie knows she should refuse. She should walk home, be the good girl everyone expects. But the motorcycle represents everything her life isn't—freedom, risk, the unknown. After a long moment, she says yes. Jack hands her a spare helmet. The chapter ends with Ruthie climbing onto the motorcycle behind him, her heart pounding with terrified exhilaration.

## Chapter 8: Freedom on Two Wheels

The motorcycle ride is revelation. Wind whipping past, ocean on one side and cliffs on the other, stars overhead, the pure rush of movement and speed. Ruthie has to hold onto Jack to stay balanced, and she's acutely aware of every point of contact. They ride north along the coast highway, past dark beaches and sleeping towns. Jack knows all the best viewpoints, pulls over at a scenic overlook where they can see miles of moonlit ocean. Standing there, Ruthie feels more alive than she has in years. Jack asks her what she'd write about if she could write about anything. She admits she'd write about people who feel trapped in their own lives. He understands—says that's exactly why he rides, to feel like he's choosing his own direction. They talk about dreams and fears until Ruthie realizes it's almost midnight. Jack gets her home at 11:58. Before she goes inside, he says, "Thanks for trusting me." The chapter ends with Ruthie in bed, unable to sleep, feeling like her world just got bigger.

## Chapter 9: Secret Evening Meetings

The midnight rides become routine. Twice a week after her late shifts, Jack is waiting. Sometimes they ride, sometimes they just walk the pier and talk. Ruthie learns about his love of books, his wandering life, how he sees the world. He asks her real questions about her dreams and actually listens to the answers. With Jack, Ruthie doesn't have to perform being the good daughter or dutiful girlfriend—she can just be herself. They establish their own world separate from the diner and the town. Diane notices Ruthie's distraction and excitement, demands details. Ruthie admits she's been seeing Jack but swears Diane to secrecy. Diane thinks it's wildly romantic, like a movie. Meanwhile, Tommy complains that Ruthie seems distant lately. She reassures him but feels guilty for the lie. The chapter ends with Ruthie and Jack sitting on the pier at midnight, legs dangling over the water, Jack asking about her family.

## Chapter 10: Jack's Truth

On the pier late one Thursday night, Ruthie finally asks Jack the question everyone wants answered: where he's from and why he's here. Jack is quiet for a long moment, then begins to share. He's from Nevada, a town smaller than Seaside Heights. His father drinks, has since Jack's mother left when he was twelve. Jack dropped out of school at seventeen to work and help with bills, but his father drank away everything anyway. One night after a bad fight, Jack packed his duffel bag and left on the motorcycle he'd bought with savings. He's been moving town to town for the past year, working odd jobs, trying to figure out who he is away from all that damage. He ended up in Seaside Heights because the ocean seemed like the edge of the world, a good place to stop running. Ruthie sees past the leather jacket to the lonely, hurting boy underneath. She takes his hand. Jack admits he's never told anyone this before. The chapter ends with a new intimacy between them—he's not dangerous, just hurt.

## Chapter 11: Deepening Connection

Jack and Ruthie's relationship shifts into deeper territory. Their conversations become more personal, more vulnerable. Jack talks about books he's read during his travels, shares observations about people and places. Ruthie reads him entries from her journal, something she's never done with anyone. He encourages her to write more, to document the town and its characters the way she sees them. One night, Jack reveals he's been working at a garage outside town, saving money, trying to figure out if he should stay in Seaside Heights or keep moving. Ruthie realizes she wants him to stay, which scares her because it means she's falling for him. During the day at the diner, she catches herself watching the clock until his usual arrival time. Rita notices and makes pointed comments about girls who lose their heads over the wrong kind of boy. Ruthie doesn't care. The chapter ends with their first almost-kiss, interrupted by a car pulling into the pier parking lot.

## Chapter 12: Tommy's Suspicions

Tommy notices Ruthie's distance has grown into real absence. She's less available, distracted when they're together, doesn't laugh at his jokes anymore. He confronts her after a movie, asking directly if something's wrong, if she's unhappy with him. Ruthie tries to reassure him but can't fake the enthusiasm she used to feel. Tommy asks if she's seeing someone else. Ruthie denies it—technically she and Jack aren't "together"—but the lie feels heavy. Tommy gets frustrated, says he's trying to build a future for them and she seems to be pulling away from it. He doesn't understand what's changed. Ruthie realizes the truth: nothing changed except her willingness to accept a future she doesn't want. But she can't explain this to Tommy, who sees his planned life as a gift, not a cage. They part tensely. Ruthie feels guilt but also resentment that Tommy assumes she wants what he wants.

## Chapter 13: Diane's Warning

Diane corners Ruthie in the diner's back room, worried and protective. She's heard gossip about Ruthie being seen with Jack late at night. Diane thought it was romantic at first, but now the whole town is talking. People say Jack is trouble, that he's taking advantage of Ruthie, that she's throwing away a good future with Tommy for a drifter who'll leave her broken-hearted. Diane, as her best friend, feels obligated to warn her. She admits Jack is attractive in a dangerous way, but asks what Ruthie really thinks will happen—does she think he'll stay? Does she think her parents will accept him? Ruthie defends Jack, says people judge him without knowing him. Diane counters that it doesn't matter if they're wrong; what matters is that Ruthie's reputation is suffering. In their conservative town, a girl seen with the wrong boy becomes the wrong girl. The chapter ends with Ruthie angry at Diane for parroting the town's prejudices but also frightened she might be right.

## Chapter 14: Jack's Vulnerability

During a late-night talk on the pier, Jack opens up further about his past. He describes his mother leaving, how he came home from school one day and her closet was empty. His father told him she couldn't handle their life anymore, but Jack always believed it was his fault somehow. He talks about taking care of his drunk father through high school, missing classes to work, having no friends because he was ashamed to bring anyone home. He admits he left not just because of a fight but because he was afraid of becoming like his father—angry, bitter, stuck. Jack's voice cracks when he says he's not good at staying places, at being close to people, because everyone he's cared about has eventually left or let him down. Ruthie sees how deeply wounded he is beneath the tough exterior. She tells him he's not his father, that running from damage doesn't make you damaged. The vulnerability between them deepens. Jack almost says something important but holds back.

## Chapter 15: Journalism Dreams Encouraged

Mr. Henderson, the retired newspaper editor, has been watching Ruthie's growing distraction with knowing eyes. During the breakfast rush, he asks her pointedly if she's applied to any colleges yet. Ruthie admits she's afraid to—afraid of her parents' reaction, afraid of leaving, afraid she's not good enough. Mr. Henderson tells her fear is a poor excuse for not trying. He offers to read her writing, help her prepare application essays, provide recommendations. That night, Ruthie tells Jack about Mr. Henderson's offer while they sit on the beach after her shift. Jack immediately encourages her to do it, to apply to schools far from Seaside Heights, to chase the life she dreams about. Ruthie realizes Jack wants her to leave, to have opportunities he never had. She asks what would happen to them if she left. Jack says her dreams are more important than his feelings. The conversation reveals that they both understand this relationship has an expiration date built in.

## Chapter 16: The Public Proposal

The town's summer picnic is a major social event. Ruthie attends with Tommy, who's been extra attentive lately, trying to win back her attention. Ruthie's parents are there, plus half the town. After the pie-eating contest, Tommy stands up on the bandstand and asks for everyone's attention. Ruthie's stomach drops—she knows what's coming. Tommy gets down on one knee in front of the entire town, pulls out his grandmother's ring, and asks Ruthie to marry him. Everyone applauds, beaming at the wholesome young couple. Ruthie's parents are crying happy tears. Diane is squealing. And Ruthie can't breathe. She looks at Tommy's expectant face, the ring, the crowd of people waiting for her yes, and all she feels is trapped. Without thinking, she says she's sorry and runs. She literally runs away from the picnic, leaving Tommy kneeling with the ring, leaving everyone stunned and confused. She keeps running until she reaches the pier, gasping and crying.

## Chapter 17: Town Judgment

Jack finds Ruthie on the pier, crying and panicking. He holds her while she gasps out what happened. She didn't mean to humiliate Tommy publicly, but she couldn't say yes to a future that would erase her dreams. Jack tells her she did the right thing, that saying yes would have been crueler. Meanwhile, back at the picnic, the town reacts with shock and gossip. Tommy is humiliated and angry. Ruthie's parents are horrified and confused. Diane tries to defend Ruthie but doesn't really understand herself. By the next morning, the story has spread throughout Seaside Heights. At the diner, customers whisper and stare. Rita is coldly disappointed, saying Ruthie broke a good boy's heart. Strangers who don't know the full story judge her for refusing a public proposal. The narrative becomes: good girl throws away perfect future, probably for that dangerous stranger. Ruthie realizes that in a small town, your reputation is your currency, and she just spent all of hers.

## Chapter 18: Breaking Up with Tommy

Ruthie knows she owes Tommy a real conversation. She meets him at the hardware store after his shift. Tommy is hurt, angry, and baffled. He asks what he did wrong, what he could have done differently. Ruthie tries to explain that he didn't do anything wrong—he's exactly who he's always been. The problem is that she's changed, or maybe she's finally being honest about what she wants. She tells him about her journalism dreams, about wanting to leave Seaside Heights, about feeling trapped in the life everyone planned for her. Tommy argues that dreams are fine but responsibilities matter more. He says she's being selfish, choosing fantasy over real life. Ruthie realizes they're speaking different languages—what Tommy sees as security, she sees as prison. She tells him she's sorry for hurting him, but she can't marry him. Tommy asks if it's because of Jack. Ruthie says no—it's because of her. But Tommy doesn't believe her. The chapter ends with Tommy asking her not to contact him again.

## Chapter 19: Parental Fury

Ruthie's parents are waiting when she comes home. The confrontation is intense and painful. Carol is hurt and bewildered—how could Ruthie humiliate Tommy that way, embarrass the family, throw away a secure future? Ben is colder, angrier. He demands to know if this is about the motorcycle boy. Ruthie admits she's been seeing Jack but insists this isn't about choosing Jack over Tommy—it's about choosing herself. Her parents don't accept this distinction. Carol cries that Ruthie is throwing her life away on a drifter who will break her heart. Ben forbids her from seeing Jack again, says if she's living under their roof she'll follow their rules. Ruthie tries to explain about college, journalism, wanting more than Seaside Heights offers. Her parents see this as rejection of them and everything they've built. The argument escalates until Ben grounds Ruthie, telling her she'll work at the diner under supervision and come straight home after. No more late nights, no more Jack. Ruthie feels her world closing in.

## Chapter 20: Sneaking Out

Ruthie obeys for three days, serving at the diner under her mother's watchful eye, going straight home, staying in her room. But on the third night, she climbs out her bedroom window after her parents are asleep. She finds Jack at the pier—their usual meeting spot. She's angry and desperate, raging about feeling suffocated, trapped, controlled. Jack listens without judgment. But when Ruthie talks about their future together, about maybe running away, Jack gets quiet. He tells her she can't run away from college applications to chase him—that's just trading one trap for another. Ruthie argues that she wants to be with him. Jack says he wants that too, but not if it means she gives up her dreams. They have an emotional confrontation about what they mean to each other, about whether this relationship has a real future. Ruthie accuses Jack of not caring enough to fight for them. Jack says caring means wanting what's best for her, even if that doesn't include him. They part angrily and confused.

## Chapter 21: Jack's Decision to Leave

Jack doesn't show up at the diner the next day. Or the day after. Ruthie is hurt and worried, but her parents' supervision makes it impossible to go find him. On the third day, Diane mentions she heard Jack gave notice at the garage where he works. Ruthie's heart drops. That evening, she sneaks out again and finds Jack at his small rented room above the garage. He's packing his duffel bag. Jack explains that he's been thinking about everything—about Ruthie's ruined reputation, her parents' fury, Tommy's humiliation, the whole town turning against her—and it's all because of him. He's poison to her future. Everyone was right to warn her away. The best thing he can do for Ruthie is leave, let the town forgive her, let her repair relationships and go to college without his shadow over her. Ruthie begs him to stay. Jack says staying would be selfish. He kisses her forehead and tells her she deserves everything good. The chapter ends with Jack saying he'll leave in the morning.

## Chapter 22: Ruthie's Dark Night

Ruthie returns home devastated. In her room, she faces the wreckage of her life: Tommy gone, parents furious, town judging her, Jack leaving. She wonders if everyone was right—if she destroyed a perfectly good future chasing something that was never real. Maybe she should have said yes to Tommy, stayed small and safe, accepted the life laid out for her. But even in her misery, Ruthie knows she couldn't have done it. Saying yes would have been a slower kind of dying. She pulls out her journal and writes through the night, working through her feelings. By dawn, something clarifies: she didn't choose Jack over her future—she chose honest truth over comfortable lies. Losing Jack will hurt, but losing herself would have been worse. She realizes she can't let him leave believing he ruined her life. If this ends, it has to end with truth between them. The chapter ends with Ruthie determined to find Jack before he leaves.

## Chapter 23: Racing to the Pier

Ruthie's morning shift starts at six, but she doesn't go to the diner. Instead, she heads to Jack's room above the garage. He's already gone, motorcycle missing. Ruthie panics—she's too late. But then she remembers: Jack always loved the pier at sunrise. She runs the six blocks to the ocean, her heart pounding, afraid she's missed him. She reaches the pier breathless and sees him there at the end, standing alone, looking at the water. His motorcycle is parked nearby, duffel bag strapped to it. He hasn't left yet. Ruthie walks out onto the pier, and Jack turns when he hears her footsteps. They stare at each other, the morning sun rising behind him. Jack starts to say something about how he needs to go, but Ruthie cuts him off. She has things to say, and he needs to listen. The chapter ends with Ruthie taking a deep breath, ready to speak her truth.

## Chapter 24: Ruthie's Declaration

Ruthie tells Jack that everyone has been trying to tell her what she wants, what she should do, who she should be—but nobody actually asked what she wants. She spent her whole life being the good daughter, the good girlfriend, the good girl, and it nearly suffocated her. When her parents forbid her from seeing Jack, when the town judged her for refusing Tommy, when everyone said she was throwing her life away—for the first time, she understood something clearly: her life is hers to throw away or build. She's not choosing Jack over her dreams. She's not giving up college or journalism or her future. She's choosing herself—choosing to be honest about what she wants and who she is. And yes, she wants him, but not because he's rebellion or escape or a way out. She wants him because with him, she feels like herself. Jack tries to argue that he's still leaving town, that he doesn't have anything to offer her. Ruthie says she doesn't need him to save her or give her a future—she'll build her own future. She just wants him to be part of it, if he wants that too.

## Chapter 25: Jack's Fear and Hope

Jack admits that he's terrified. He's never stayed anywhere, never built anything that lasted. Everyone he's ever cared about has left him or been better off without him. He figured it was safer to leave first, before Ruthie realized he wasn't worth the trouble. But Ruthie sees past his tough exterior to the scared boy underneath. She tells him that love isn't about safety or guarantees—it's about choosing to try even when you're scared. She asks him what he actually wants, not what he thinks he should do. Jack's walls finally crumble. He admits he's been falling for her since that first day at the counter, that she's the first person who ever saw past his leather jacket to who he really is. He wants to stay, wants to build something real with her, but he's afraid he doesn't know how. Ruthie says they'll figure it out together. Neither of them has a map for this, but that's okay. The chapter ends with Jack taking her hands, really looking at her, seeing her clearly for the first time without his fear in the way.

## Chapter 26: Building Something Real

They sit on the pier as the sun rises fully, finally talking honestly about what a real future between them might look like. Ruthie tells Jack about the college applications Mr. Henderson is helping her prepare—she's applying to schools in San Francisco, following her journalism dreams. She'll leave Seaside Heights, but not to run away—to run toward something. Jack says he's been thinking about staying in Seaside Heights, working at the garage where the owner offered him a permanent position. He could save money, maybe take night classes at the community college, build a real life instead of running from town to town. They acknowledge the reality: she'll leave for college in a year, they'll be apart, long-distance won't be easy. But for the first time, both of them are willing to try, to build something honest even if it's uncertain. Ruthie says she doesn't need promises about forever—she just needs him to be real with her. Jack says he can do that. They talk about facing her parents together, about Jack proving to the town that he's not who they think he is, about Ruthie standing firm in her choices.

## Chapter 27: Truth and Vulnerability

Jack asks Ruthie what happens when college starts, when she's in San Francisco meeting new people, living the life she's dreamed of. Won't she outgrow him? Ruthie says maybe they'll both outgrow who they are now—that's the point of growing up. But she doesn't want to lose him in the process. Jack admits he's never had someone want to keep him before. They talk about his fear of abandonment, her fear of disappointing people, how both of them have been running from the same thing—being truly known. On this pier at sunrise, they finally let each other in completely. Jack tells Ruthie she's the first person who ever made him want to stay anywhere. Ruthie tells Jack he's the first person who ever encouraged her to go. They realize that's what real love is: supporting each other's growth even when it's hard or scary. The vulnerability between them is complete, nothing held back, all walls down. Jack cups her face and tells her he's falling in love with her. Ruthie says she's already there.

## Chapter 28: The Sunrise Kiss

The emotional conversation gives way to a perfect moment of stillness. They're alone on the pier, the ocean stretching to the horizon, the sunrise painting everything gold. Jack brushes his thumb across Ruthie's cheek, asks if he can kiss her. Ruthie nods, her heart racing. Their first kiss is gentle, tentative, full of promise and possibility. It's nothing like the practiced kisses with Tommy—this feels like truth, like recognition, like coming home and setting out on an adventure simultaneously. When they pull apart, both of them are smiling, a little scared, a lot hopeful. They stay on the pier as the morning grows lighter, holding each other, talking about next steps. Jack will stay in Seaside Heights, work at the garage, build a real life. Ruthie will apply to colleges, pursue journalism, follow her dreams. They'll try to make this work despite the distance, despite the uncertainty, because what they have is worth fighting for. The chapter ends with them walking back from the pier hand in hand as the town begins to wake.

## Chapter 29: Facing Forward Together

Ruthie and Jack walk into the diner together that morning. The breakfast crowd goes quiet. Carol and Ben are behind the counter, preparing for the morning rush. When they see Ruthie walk in with Jack, her hand in his, their expressions harden. Ruthie doesn't flinch. She introduces Jack properly to her parents, asks if they can talk. The conversation is difficult but honest. Ruthie tells her parents she's applying to colleges in San Francisco, that she's choosing journalism over taking over the diner, that she's sorry to disappoint them but she has to live her own life. Jack stands beside her quietly, letting her fight her own battle but making it clear he supports her. Ben is angry, Carol is hurt, but they can't deny the strength in their daughter's voice. Rita watches from behind the coffee pot, impressed despite herself. Mr. Henderson comes in for breakfast and vouches for Ruthie's talent, says she'd be wasting herself not pursuing journalism. Gradually, the tension eases slightly. Ruthie's parents don't give their blessing, but they stop actively opposing. The chapter ends with Jack ordering coffee and pie at Ruthie's counter, just like always, but now everyone knows what he means to her.

## Chapter 30: Cherry Coke and New Beginnings

Three months later, it's late summer. Ruthie's college acceptance letter to San Francisco State arrived yesterday—she got in with a partial scholarship for journalism. Jack's working full-time at the garage and enrolled in night classes at the community college. They've built something real in the time since the pier sunrise. Ruthie's relationship with her parents has slowly thawed; they're not thrilled about her choices but they're learning to accept them. Tommy has moved on, dating a girl from the next town over. Diane remains loyal, fascinated by how Ruthie's life turned out. On Ruthie's last shift before leaving for college, she serves Jack a Cherry Coke at the counter, their inside joke. He tells her he'll miss her but he's proud of her. That evening, Jack waits outside the diner on his motorcycle. Ruthie comes out in her uniform for the last time, feeling bittersweet about leaving but excited for what's ahead. Jack says he has something to show her. They ride up the coast highway to their favorite overlook. He promises to visit her in San Francisco, to write letters, to wait for her. Ruthie promises the same. They kiss as the sun sets over the ocean, and for once, the future doesn't feel like a trap—it feels like possibility. The novel ends with them riding back toward town together, Ruthie holding tight to Jack, both of them heading toward their separate dreams but committed to finding their way back to each other. The last line: "Some endings are just new beginnings wearing different clothes."
