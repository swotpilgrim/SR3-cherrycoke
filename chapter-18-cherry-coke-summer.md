# Chapter 18: Breaking Up with Tommy

Two days passed before I worked up the courage to face Tommy. Two days of guilty avoidance, of taking the long way home to avoid Richardson Hardware, of scanning the diner before each shift to make sure he wasn't there. Two days of carrying the weight of unfinished business.

But I couldn't avoid him forever. And he deserved better than my cowardice.

On Monday evening, after my shift ended, I walked to the hardware store. My stomach churned with every step. The CLOSED sign hung on the door, but I could see lights on in the back. I knocked, waited, knocked again.

Tommy appeared from the stockroom, saw me through the glass, and his expression went carefully blank. For a long moment, I thought he wouldn't open the door. But finally, reluctantly, he turned the lock.

"Ruthie." His voice was flat, drained of its usual warmth.

"Hi, Tommy." My hands twisted together nervously. "Can we talk? Please?"

He stepped back silently, letting me in. The familiar smell of sawdust and paint and new tools surrounded me—I'd been in this store a thousand times, but tonight it felt foreign. Hostile territory.

Tommy led me to the back office where his father usually did paperwork. He didn't sit, just leaned against the desk with his arms crossed, maintaining distance between us. In the harsh fluorescent light, I could see the shadows under his eyes, the tension in his jaw.

"I'm sorry," I started, because it was the only place to begin. "I'm so sorry, Tommy. For everything. For how it happened, for humiliating you in front of everyone—"

"You should be." His voice was hard, nothing like the sweet boy who'd proposed two days ago. "Do you have any idea what the last two days have been like? Everyone staring, everyone asking if I'm okay, everyone knowing that you—" He broke off, jaw clenching. "That you rejected me in front of the whole town."

"I know. It was awful and I handled it terribly. I should have talked to you before it got to that point. I should have been clearer about—"

"About what?" Tommy's voice rose. "About the fact that you didn't want to marry me? About the fact that you've been pulling away for weeks? About the fact that you've apparently been sneaking around with some drifter?"

I flinched at the anger in his tone, but I couldn't deny any of it. "Yes. All of that. I should have been honest with you sooner."

"Why weren't you?" The question came out raw, hurt underneath the anger. "We were together for two years, Ruthie. Two years. I thought we were happy. I thought we wanted the same things."

"We were happy," I said carefully. "Or at least, I thought we were. But then I started realizing that what made you happy and what I needed were different things."

"Different how?" Tommy pushed off the desk, frustration making him restless. "I offered you everything. A home, security, a future. What more do you want?"

"I want to go to college. I want to study journalism. I want to see the world beyond Seaside Heights." The words tumbled out, gaining strength as I spoke them. "I want to write and travel and experience things before I settle down. And I can't do any of that if I marry you at eighteen and move into that house on Maple Street."

"So this is about college?" Tommy's laugh was bitter. "You're throwing away a real relationship, a real future, for some fantasy about becoming a writer?"

"It's not a fantasy. It's what I want. What I've always wanted."

"Since when?" He was pacing now. "You never talked about college before. You never said you wanted to leave."

"Because I was afraid to say it out loud. Afraid of disappointing my parents, afraid of rocking the boat, afraid of—" I swallowed hard. "Afraid of losing you."

"Well, congratulations. You did it anyway."

The words stung, but I pushed forward. "You're right. And I'm sorry. But Tommy, even if I hadn't figured out the college thing, even if Jack had never come to town—I still couldn't have said yes."

"Why not?" The question was almost a plea. "What was so wrong with what we had?"

"Nothing was wrong with it. That's not—" I struggled to find the right words. "You're a good person. You'd make a wonderful husband. But not for me. Not now. Maybe not ever."

"Because of him?" Tommy's voice hardened again. "Because of Jack Malone?"

"This isn't about Jack."

"Isn't it? Everyone's saying you've been seeing him. That you chose him over me. That you're throwing your life away for some nobody on a motorcycle." Tommy stopped pacing to face me directly. "Is it true? Are you with him?"

The direct question hung between us. I could lie, could try to soften it. But I'd done enough lying.

"I've been spending time with him," I admitted. "We talk. He's become...important to me."

"Important." Tommy repeated the word like it tasted bad. "More important than two years with me? More important than the future we planned?"

"The future you planned," I corrected gently. "You decided we'd get married, where we'd live, what our life would look like. You never asked what I wanted."

"I assumed you wanted what I wanted! We're supposed to be partners. We're supposed to want the same things."

"But we don't." It was the simplest truth, and the hardest to say. "You want to stay in Seaside Heights forever. You want to work at your dad's store and have a family and never leave. And that's fine, Tommy. That's a good life. But it's not my life."

"So what is your life?" He was almost shouting now. "Running off to some big city with a guy you barely know? Chasing some pipe dream about being a writer? Ruthie, that's not reality. Reality is right here—steady work, family, people who care about you. Me, caring about you."

"I know you care. I do. But caring isn't enough if we want different things."

"When did you become so selfish?" The accusation hit like a slap. "The Ruthie I knew thought about other people. She cared about her family, her community. She didn't just throw everything away on a whim."

"It's not a whim!" My own temper flared. "And it's not selfish to want something for myself. To have dreams and ambitions beyond being someone's wife."

"There's nothing wrong with being someone's wife!"

"I didn't say there was! But I'm seventeen, Tommy. Seventeen. I'm not ready to make that decision yet. I need time to figure out who I am before I become somebody's anything."

"You had time. We've been together for two years."

"And for two years, I went along with what you wanted because it was easier than admitting what I wanted. But I can't do that anymore." My voice softened. "I can't live my life trying to be the person everyone expects. It's suffocating me."

Tommy was quiet for a long moment, the anger draining out of him, leaving just hurt. "So that's it? We're done? Just like that?"

"I don't think we were really together anymore, Tommy. Not for a while now. I think we were both holding onto something that had already ended."

"I wasn't ready for it to end," he said quietly. "I loved you. I still do."

The admission made my chest ache. "I care about you too. I always will. You're a good person and you deserve someone who wants the same life you do. Who's excited about that house on Maple Street and working at the hardware store and staying in Seaside Heights forever. That person exists, Tommy. She's just not me."

"She was you," Tommy said, and there was sadness now instead of anger. "Or I thought she was. I don't know when you changed. Or maybe I just never really knew you at all."

"Maybe we both changed," I offered. "Or maybe we were never quite as compatible as we thought."

Tommy walked to the office door, opened it—a clear dismissal. "I need you to go now."

I stood, hesitating. "Can we—is there any chance we could eventually be friends? Once everything settles down?"

"No." The word was final. "I can't be friends with you, Ruthie. I can't watch you live the life you chose over me. I can't pretend I'm okay with this."

"I understand." And I did, even though it hurt. "For what it's worth, I really am sorry. I never wanted to hurt you."

"But you did anyway." Tommy wouldn't look at me. "Please go."

I walked past him through the store, feeling his pain like a weight on my shoulders. At the door, I paused. "I hope you find someone who makes you happy, Tommy. You deserve that."

He didn't respond. Didn't acknowledge I'd spoken. Just stood there waiting for me to leave.

So I did.

The evening air hit my face, warm and salt-tinged. Main Street was quiet. I walked slowly, processing what had just happened.

I'd ended it. Officially, finally. There was no going back, no fixing it. Whatever Tommy and I had been was over.

And underneath the guilt and the sadness was something else: relief. The same terrible, shameful relief I'd felt running from the picnic. The relief of truth finally told, of pretending finally abandoned.

I found myself walking toward the pier without consciously deciding to. It had become my refuge, the place I went when everything felt too heavy. Jack wasn't there—he was working late at the garage—but I sat at our usual spot anyway, letting the sound of waves calm my racing thoughts.

I'd hurt Tommy. Badly. That would be something I'd have to carry with me, a consequence of my choices I couldn't undo. But staying with him, marrying him, building a life I didn't want—that would have hurt us both even more. Just slower. Just more permanently.

Choosing yourself wasn't selfish, I realized. Sometimes it was the most honest thing you could do.

The sun was setting, painting the sky in shades of orange and purple. I pulled out my journal and wrote about the conversation, about Tommy's hurt and anger, about the weight of guilt and the lightness of freedom existing simultaneously.

I wrote: "Breaking someone's heart is awful. But breaking your own heart slowly over years of pretending would be worse."

When I finally headed home, I felt lighter despite the painful conversation. I'd faced Tommy. I'd told him the truth. I'd chosen to be honest even when it hurt.

It was done. For better or worse, it was done.

And now I could finally stop looking back and start looking forward.
