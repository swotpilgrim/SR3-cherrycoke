# Chapter 30: Cherry Coke and New Beginnings

Three months later—Late August

The diner smelled like coffee and bacon grease, familiar and bittersweet. This was my last shift.

Tomorrow I'd board a bus to San Francisco. My acceptance letter to San Francisco State sat in my journal—real, official, proof that dreams could become reality when you were brave enough to chase them.

"One cherry Coke, please," a familiar voice said.

I turned to find Jack at the counter, work shirt smudged with grease, hair still damp from his post-work shower. Three months of permanence had changed him—he stood straighter, smiled easier, looked less like someone ready to run.

"You know we don't serve that," I said, but I was already reaching for the Coca-Cola and cherry syrup.

"I know. But I figure on your last day, you might make an exception."

I mixed the drink the way I had that first day—careful measurements, the perfect ratio of sweet to fizz. When I slid it across the counter, our fingers touched, and the spark was still there. Three months together, and it still felt electric.

"How was work?" I asked.

"Good. Really good, actually." Jack took a sip of the cherry Coke, his eyes lighting up. "Mr. Murphy promoted me to lead mechanic. Means a dollar more an hour, plus I get to supervise the new guys."

Pride swelled in my chest. "Jack, that's wonderful!"

"Yeah." He ducked his head, shy about the praise. "And I got my GED results back yesterday. Passed with high marks. I can start those night classes at the community college in September."

"Business management?"

"Business management." He met my eyes. "Murphy mentioned wanting to retire in five years or so. Said if I learned the business side, he might consider selling me the garage. Not a promise, but—"

"But a possibility," I finished. "You're building something real."

"We both are," he said, reaching across the counter to take my hand.

The bell chimed, and I looked up to see Mr. Henderson, Diane, and—surprisingly—Tommy.

Tommy approached the counter, his expression uncertain but not hostile. "Hey, Ruthie. Heard you're leaving tomorrow."

"Yeah. San Francisco State. Journalism program."

"That's good." He seemed to mean it. "You always wanted more than this place could offer. I get that now." He paused. "I'm seeing Melissa Porter, from the next town over. She wants what I want—house, family, staying local. It's better this way."

Relief flooded through me. "I'm happy for you. Really."

"Yeah." He managed a small smile. "Good luck, Ruthie. Go show San Francisco what you're made of."

He left, and I realized I was blinking back tears. But they were good tears—the kind that came from closure, from wounds beginning to heal.

Diane hugged me tight. "I'm going to miss you so much. Who's going to tell me when I'm being ridiculous?"

"You're going to figure it out yourself," I said, hugging her back. "You're braver than you think, Di."

"Write to me?"

"Every week. I promise."

Mr. Henderson was last, pressing a small wrapped package into my hands. "For the bus ride. Don't open it until you're on your way."

"Mr. Henderson, I can't thank you enough—"

"You don't need to thank me. Just keep writing, keep questioning, keep being curious about the world." His eyes were bright. "You're going to do amazing things, Ruthie. I'm proud to have been your teacher."

The dinner crowd started filing in—construction workers and businessmen, families and couples. People I'd served for years. Mrs. Patterson, who'd been scandalized by my rejection of Tommy, actually stopped to wish me well. Mr. Chen gave me a twenty-dollar bill "for textbooks." Even my parents, working the kitchen and register, seemed softer tonight, more accepting.

My mother approached during a lull, wiping her hands on her apron. "You have everything you need?"

"I think so. Clothes, books, your address book so I can write—"

"I put some extra money in your bag. For emergencies." She still wouldn't meet my eyes. "And I packed you some cookies. The oatmeal raisin ones you like."

"Mom—"

"I'm still not happy about this," she said quickly. "About you leaving, about him." She glanced at Jack. "But I'm proud of you. For going after what you want, even when it was hard."

I hugged her, feeling her tense then slowly relax into it. "I love you."

"I love you too, baby. So much." Her voice cracked. "Be safe. Call us when you get there."

"I will. I promise."

When my shift ended, I hung up my apron for the last time. Jack was waiting outside, leaning against his motorcycle.

"One last ride?" he asked.

"Please."

We rode up the coast highway as the sun began its descent, painting the sky orange and pink. Jack pulled over at our overlook—the place where we'd had our first real conversation, where I'd first admitted my dreams of leaving.

We sat on the cliff's edge, legs dangling, the ocean vast and endless below us.

"I'm going to miss you so much," I said.

"I'm going to miss you too." He took my hand, lacing our fingers together. "But we're going to make this work."

"How can you be so sure?"

"Because we've already survived the hard part—being honest about what we want, choosing ourselves even when it was scary. Long-distance is just logistics. Letters and phone calls and bus rides. We can do logistics."

"What if I change?" The fear finally surfaced.

"Then I'll love the new version of you too." He cupped my face. "I promise to be honest with you. Always. About what I'm feeling, if things get too hard. Promise me the same."

"I promise."

"Then that's enough." He kissed me, soft and sure. "We'll write letters. I'll call every Sunday evening—Mr. Murphy's letting me use the garage phone. You'll come home for Thanksgiving and Christmas. And we'll figure out the rest as we go."

The sun touched the horizon, turning the ocean into liquid gold. I thought about tomorrow—the bus ride, the new city, the new life waiting. Everything I was leaving behind and everything I was bringing with me.

"Our beach," I said softly. "Where we almost lost each other and chose to try anyway."

"Our place," Jack agreed. "Where we'll come back to remember why we were brave."

The sun slipped below the horizon, and the sky blazed with color. Jack wrapped his arm around me, and I leaned into him, memorizing this moment. The smell of leather and ocean air. The sound of waves and his heartbeat. The feeling of being exactly where I was supposed to be, even though tomorrow I'd be somewhere else.

"I have something for you," Jack said, pulling a small package from his jacket.

I unwrapped it carefully. Inside was a journal—worn leather, perfect for carrying.

"It was my mother's," Jack said quietly. "The only thing she left behind. I want you to have it. Fill it with your San Francisco adventures. When you come home for Thanksgiving, you can read me the entries."

"It's perfect," I whispered. "Thank you."

"Thank you for running to that pier. For teaching me that staying could be braver than leaving."

"Thank you for seeing me," I said. "For encouraging my dreams even when it meant we'd be apart."

"Ruthie?"

"Yeah?"

"I love you. Not the version of you that's easy or convenient or stays small. I love the real you—the brave, ambitious, complicated you. The one who's leaving tomorrow to chase her dreams."

"I love you too," I said. "The real you. The one who's staying to build something. The one who's scared but doing it anyway."

We kissed as the stars came out, a long kiss that felt like promise and farewell all at once.

"We should head back," I said reluctantly. "Early bus tomorrow."

"I'll take you to the station. Six AM. I want to be the last person you see before you leave."

We rode back through the darkness. Past the beach and boardwalk, past the diner, past Murphy's Garage where Jack's future waited.

He parked in front of my house.

"This isn't goodbye," Jack said finally. "This is see you later."

"See you later," I agreed. "Tomorrow morning. Six AM."

"I'll be there."

One more kiss—gentle, sure, full of all the words we didn't need to say. Then I climbed off the bike and walked to my front door, turning one last time to wave.

Jack sat in the dim streetlight, watching until I was safely inside. Then he kickstarted his motorcycle and rode away into the night, toward Murphy's Garage and his rented room and all the tomorrows he was building.

I climbed the stairs to my room—through the front door this time, honestly. My suitcase sat packed. My acceptance letter tucked in my old journal. My future waiting.

I pulled out the journal Jack had given me and opened to the first page. By lamplight, I wrote:

*Tomorrow I leave for San Francisco. I'm scared and excited and sad and hopeful. I don't know if Jack and I will make it through the distance. I don't know what the future holds.*

*But I know I chose this. Not because it was easy or safe or what everyone wanted. I chose this because it was true. Because it was mine.*

*I chose to say no to Tommy. I chose to tell the truth even when it cost me. I chose to run to that pier. I chose myself, and in choosing myself, I found someone who could truly love me.*

*Tomorrow I board a bus toward a future I can't fully imagine. But I'm not running away. I'm running toward something—toward my dreams, toward myself, toward the life I want to build.*

*And that feels like exactly enough.*

*That feels like everything.*

I closed the journal and turned out the light. Tomorrow would come soon enough. Tonight, I would sleep in my childhood room one last time, dreaming of ocean views and newsrooms and all the versions of myself I had yet to discover.

The summer was ending. Cherry Coke summer, with all its sweetness and complications and brave, terrifying choices.

But I was just beginning.

And somewhere in the darkness, Jack was too—in his room above Murphy's Garage, probably looking out at the same stars, probably thinking about the same uncertain, beautiful future.

We were both becoming—separately but together, growing into the people we'd promised to be.

That was the bravest thing of all.
