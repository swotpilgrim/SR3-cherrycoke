# Chapter 9: Secret Evening Meetings

July melts into August. Thursday nights with Jack have become the axis around which my whole life turns.

We have a routine. I close at ten. Jack waits. We ride north, discovering hidden beaches, talking for hours or sitting in comfortable silence. Always home by midnight. Always feeling more myself with him than anywhere else.

During the week, we maintain the pretense. He arrives at 2:30 for coffee and pie. I serve him professionally, aware of Rita's watchful eyes. But there's a secret language in how I pour his coffee, how his eyes follow me, the books he leaves with marked pages.

We're hiding in plain sight, and it makes everything electric.

One Thursday in mid-August, we're sitting on an abandoned car hood at a scenic pullout, watching sunset paint the ocean orange and gold. Jack reads aloud from Cannery Row, and I'm half-listening, mostly watching his mouth form words.

"You're not paying attention."

"Something about Doc and tide pools?"

He laughs. "Close enough."

I lean my head on his shoulder. We're not officially together, but we're something. Something important.

"Tell me about your writing this week."

It's become our Thursday ritual—I share my journal observations and he asks questions like a real editor.

"I wrote about Mr. Henderson. How he comes to the diner every morning, but he's not really there for the food. He's lonely. His wife died three years ago."

"That's good. You should expand it into a profile piece." Jack tucks a strand of hair behind my ear. "You're really good at seeing the story underneath the surface."

"You're the only person who thinks so."

"Then everyone else is an idiot."

I laugh and nudge him. "What about you? What have you been reading?"

"Actually..." He hesitates, then pulls a folded newspaper clipping from his jacket pocket. "I've been reading the San Francisco Chronicle's help wanted ads."

My heart skips. "Why?"

"Because I've been thinking about what you said. About the difference between running away and moving toward something." He unfolds the clipping, smooths it against his knee. "There's a mechanic shop in San Francisco that's hiring. Full-time position, benefits, steady work. I called them yesterday."

"You did?" I sit up straight. "What did they say?"

"They want me to come in for an interview next week." He looks at me, something vulnerable in his expression. "I'm thinking about taking it. The job, I mean. If they offer it to me."

"But that would mean staying. Putting down roots."

"Yeah." He folds the clipping carefully. "It would."

I'm afraid to ask the next question, but I have to. "Why? Why now, why San Francisco?"

"Because you'll be there next year. If you get into San Francisco State—and you will—you'll be there studying journalism. And I—" He stops, takes a breath. "I want to be there too. Not because I'm following you or trying to control your choices. But because maybe we could both be choosing the same place. Building something together."

My throat goes tight with emotion. "Jack—"

"I know it's fast. I know we haven't even talked about what we are or where this is going. But Ruthie, I've spent a year running from everything, and then I met you and suddenly I want to run toward something instead. Toward a life, a future, a—" He can't finish the sentence, but I hear what he's not saying.

Toward us.

"I haven't even applied to San Francisco State yet," I admit. "Mr. Henderson gave me the forms, but I haven't filled them out. I keep thinking about my parents' reaction, about Tommy, about disappointing everyone."

"What about disappointing yourself?"

It's the same question he keeps asking, in different forms, and every time it hits like a revelation.

"I'm scared," I whisper. "What if I'm not good enough? What if I get there and discover I don't belong?"

Jack takes my hand, laces our fingers together. "Then you'll figure it out. But Ruthie, you'll never know if you don't try. And I think—" He pauses. "I think you're brave enough to try."

"I don't feel brave."

"Brave people never do. They're just more afraid of not trying than they are of failing."

We sit in silence as the sunset deepens to purple and the first stars appear. The ocean below us whispers secrets, and Jack's hand in mine feels like an anchor and a compass both—something solid to hold onto and something pointing toward a direction.

"I need to tell Tommy," I say finally. "It's not fair, what I'm doing. Letting him think we have a future when I'm—" I can't finish.

"When you're what?"

"When I'm falling for someone else."

The confession hangs in the air between us. We've danced around it for weeks, this feeling that's been building, but neither of us has said it out loud.

Jack's hand tightens on mine. "Are you? Falling for someone else?"

I look at him—really look at him. The dark eyes that see me completely. The scar through his eyebrow from some past hurt. The leather jacket and the motorcycle and all the armor he wears against a world that's hurt him. And underneath it all, the thoughtful soul who reads Steinbeck and encourages my dreams and makes me feel like I'm enough exactly as I am.

"Yes," I say. "I am."

His smile is slow and devastating. "Good. Because I've been falling for you since the day you served me that first cup of coffee."

The next day, Diane corners me by the soda fountain.

"Okay, spill. You're glowing."

"Nothing's going on."

"Ruthie Davis, you're in love with the motorcycle boy!"

"Diane, shh!" I glance around. Rita's at table four, out of earshot.

"I knew it! Have you kissed him?"

"No! We've just been talking. Riding sometimes."

"Ruthie!" Her voice goes up. "You've been on his motorcycle? This is so romantic!"

"You can't tell anyone."

"I won't." She leans closer. "But what about Tommy?"

My stomach drops. "I need to tell him. I don't know how."

"Do you love him? Jack, I mean?"

The question stops me cold. Love. But when I think about Thursday nights, Jack's belief in my dreams, how he sees me—

"I think I might. Is that crazy? It's only been six weeks."

"You've been dating Tommy for two years and never looked the way you look talking about Jack." Diane squeezes my hand. "That's not crazy. That's real."

Rita appears suddenly, making both of us jump.

"You two planning to work today, or just gossip?"

"Working, Rita!" Diane grabs a coffeepot and flees.

I return to my napkin dispensers, but Rita lingers.

"That motorcycle boy still coming in every day?"

"Yes, Rita."

"And you're still just serving him coffee and pie?"

I meet her eyes. "What else would I be doing?"

She studies me for a long moment. "I don't know, honey. But whatever it is, be careful. Boys like that—they make big promises but they don't stick around when things get hard."

"Maybe you're wrong about him."

"Maybe. But I've been wrong about a lot fewer things than I've been right about." She pats my shoulder. "Just don't go breaking your heart, okay? Or Tommy's."

Thursday night comes again. Jack is waiting under the streetlight, but this time when I climb on the motorcycle, he doesn't head north on the highway. Instead, he drives to the pier, parks at the far end where no one goes.

We walk out to the end, our footsteps echoing on the wooden planks. The ocean stretches dark and endless below us, and the town glitters behind us, distant and small.

"I need to know something. Are you ashamed of us? Is that why we're secret?"

"No. Jack, I'm not ashamed."

"Then why can't we be together openly?"

"Because my parents would forbid it. Tommy would be hurt. The whole town would judge me." I lean on the railing. "I'm not ready for the fallout."

"When will you be ready?"

"After I talk to Tommy. After I apply to college. I don't know."

Jack is quiet. Then: "I'm not asking you to choose me over your dreams. But I need to know if there's a future here or if we're just killing time."

"Is that what you think?"

"I don't know. Six weeks of perfect Thursday nights, secret conversations. But what happens when you go to San Francisco? Do I fit into that, or am I just a summer romance?"

The hurt in his voice breaks my heart.

"You're not a summer romance. Jack, you're the person who made me believe I could have a real life. Who encouraged my dreams when everyone else dismissed them."

"Then prove it. Apply to college. Tell Tommy. Stop hiding."

"I will. I just need more time."

"How much?"

"I don't know."

He grips the railing, shoulders tight. "I can't keep being your secret. It's killing me. Every day I pretend you're just the waitress, pretend I'm not completely in love with you—"

He stops. The words hang in the air between us.

"You love me?" My voice is barely a whisper.

Jack turns back, eyes fierce and vulnerable. "Of course I love you. You're kind and smart and brave. You see people clearly. You dream big and work hard. You made me want to stop running and start building something real."

Tears stream down my face. "I love you too."

"Then stop hiding us."

"I will. Just give me until end of summer. Two weeks. I'll tell Tommy. Apply to college. Deal with my parents."

Jack pulls me into his arms. I bury my face in his chest.

"End of summer," he says. "Two weeks. After that, I need to know where we stand."

"Okay. Two weeks."

We hold each other on the pier while the ocean crashes below, and I make a silent promise: I will be brave enough to choose this. Choose him. Choose myself.

Even if it costs me everything.
