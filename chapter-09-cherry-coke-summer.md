# Chapter 9: Secret Evening Meetings

Two weeks becomes four. Four weeks becomes six. Before I know it, July has melted into August, and Thursday nights with Jack have become the axis around which my whole life turns.

We have a routine now. I close the diner at ten. Jack waits under the streetlight. We ride north up the coast highway, discovering new overlooks, hidden beaches, winding roads that lead to nowhere important. Sometimes we talk for hours. Sometimes we sit in comfortable silence, listening to the ocean. Always, he has me home by midnight.

And always, I feel more like myself with him than I do anywhere else.

During the week, we maintain the pretense at the diner. He arrives at 2:30 for coffee and pie. I serve him with professional courtesy. We don't talk much beyond the necessary pleasantries, aware of Rita's watchful eyes and my parents working in the kitchen. But there's a secret language in how I pour his coffee, in how his eyes follow me across the diner, in the books he leaves on the counter with specific pages marked.

We're hiding in plain sight, and the secrecy makes everything feel electric.

One Thursday in mid-August, we're sitting on the hood of an abandoned car at an old scenic pullout, watching the sunset paint the ocean in shades of orange and gold. Jack is reading aloud from Cannery Row—another Steinbeck, his favorite—and I'm half-listening, mostly just watching the way his mouth forms words.

"You're not paying attention," he says without looking up from the page.

"I am."

"What did I just read?"

"Something about Doc and tide pools."

He laughs, and the sound makes my chest warm. "Close enough."

I lean my head on his shoulder, a gesture that's become natural over these weeks. We're not officially together—we've never defined what this is—but we're something. Something important.

"Tell me about your writing this week," Jack says, closing the book. "What did you observe?"

It's become a Thursday night ritual. I tell him what I've written in my journal, and he asks questions like a real editor, pushing me to dig deeper, see clearer.

"I wrote about Mr. Henderson," I say. "About how he comes to the diner every morning and orders the same breakfast, but I realized he's not really there for the food. He's lonely. His wife died three years ago, and the diner is where he goes to be around people without having to explain his grief."

"That's good. Did you write it in story form or observation?"

"Observation, mostly. But I could probably expand it into a profile piece. Talk to him more, get the details of his wife, their life together."

"You should. That's human interest journalism." Jack tucks a strand of hair behind my ear, and the casual intimacy of the gesture makes my breath catch. "You're really good at this, Ruthie. Seeing the story underneath the surface."

"You're the only person who thinks so."

"Then everyone else is an idiot."

I laugh and nudge him with my shoulder. "What about you? What have you been reading this week besides Steinbeck?"

"Actually..." He hesitates, then pulls a folded newspaper clipping from his jacket pocket. "I've been reading the San Francisco Chronicle's help wanted ads."

My heart skips. "Why?"

"Because I've been thinking about what you said. About the difference between running away and moving toward something." He unfolds the clipping, smooths it against his knee. "There's a mechanic shop in San Francisco that's hiring. Full-time position, benefits, steady work. I called them yesterday."

"You did?" I sit up straight. "What did they say?"

"They want me to come in for an interview next week." He looks at me, something vulnerable in his expression. "I'm thinking about taking it. The job, I mean. If they offer it to me."

"But that would mean staying. Putting down roots."

"Yeah." He folds the clipping carefully. "It would."

I'm afraid to ask the next question, but I have to. "Why? Why now, why San Francisco?"

"Because you'll be there next year. If you get into San Francisco State—and you will—you'll be there studying journalism. And I—" He stops, takes a breath. "I want to be there too. Not because I'm following you or trying to control your choices. But because maybe we could both be choosing the same place. Building something together."

My throat goes tight with emotion. "Jack—"

"I know it's fast. I know we haven't even talked about what we are or where this is going. But Ruthie, I've spent a year running from everything, and then I met you and suddenly I want to run toward something instead. Toward a life, a future, a—" He can't finish the sentence, but I hear what he's not saying.

Toward us.

"I haven't even applied to San Francisco State yet," I admit. "Mr. Henderson gave me the forms, but I haven't filled them out. I keep thinking about my parents' reaction, about Tommy, about disappointing everyone."

"What about disappointing yourself?"

It's the same question he keeps asking, in different forms, and every time it hits like a revelation.

"I'm scared," I whisper. "What if I'm not good enough? What if I get there and discover I don't belong?"

Jack takes my hand, laces our fingers together. "Then you'll figure it out. But Ruthie, you'll never know if you don't try. And I think—" He pauses. "I think you're brave enough to try."

"I don't feel brave."

"Brave people never do. They're just more afraid of not trying than they are of failing."

We sit in silence as the sunset deepens to purple and the first stars appear. The ocean below us whispers secrets, and Jack's hand in mine feels like an anchor and a compass both—something solid to hold onto and something pointing toward a direction.

"I need to tell Tommy," I say finally. "It's not fair, what I'm doing. Letting him think we have a future when I'm—" I can't finish.

"When you're what?"

"When I'm falling for someone else."

The confession hangs in the air between us. We've danced around it for weeks, this feeling that's been building, but neither of us has said it out loud.

Jack's hand tightens on mine. "Are you? Falling for someone else?"

I look at him—really look at him. The dark eyes that see me completely. The scar through his eyebrow from some past hurt. The leather jacket and the motorcycle and all the armor he wears against a world that's hurt him. And underneath it all, the thoughtful soul who reads Steinbeck and encourages my dreams and makes me feel like I'm enough exactly as I am.

"Yes," I say. "I am."

His smile is slow and devastating. "Good. Because I've been falling for you since the day you served me that first cup of coffee."

The conversation with Diane happens the next day, accidentally.

I'm refilling napkin dispensers during the afternoon lull when she corners me by the soda fountain, her eyes bright with suspicion.

"Okay, spill. Something's going on with you."

"Nothing's going on."

"Ruthie Davis, I've known you since elementary school. You're glowing. You're distracted. You smile at nothing. Either you've won the lottery or you're in love." She gasps. "Oh my God, you're in love with the motorcycle boy!"

"Diane, shh!" I glance around frantically. Rita is at table four, thankfully out of earshot. "I'm not—we're not—"

"You totally are! I knew it! I called it weeks ago!" She grabs my arm, practically vibrating. "Have you kissed him? Please tell me you've kissed him."

"No! We've just been talking. Riding sometimes. It's not—"

"Riding? Ruthie!" Diane's voice goes up an octave. "You've been sneaking around on his motorcycle? This is like a movie! This is the most romantic thing that's ever happened in Seaside Heights!"

"You can't tell anyone."

"I won't, I won't. I swear." She makes a cross-your-heart gesture. "But seriously, what about Tommy? Does he know?"

My stomach drops. "Not yet. I need to tell him, but I don't know how."

"Tell him you've met someone else. It's honest."

"But it's more than that. It's not just about Jack. It's about me wanting something different—college, journalism, life outside this town. Tommy can't give me that. He doesn't even understand why I'd want it."

Diane is quiet for a moment, twirling a strand of blonde hair. "Do you love him? Jack, I mean?"

The question stops me cold. Love. It's such a big word for something that's only been six weeks. But when I think about Thursday nights on the coast highway, about Jack's steady belief in my dreams, about how he sees me and still chooses to stay—

"I think I might," I admit. "Is that crazy? It's only been six weeks."

"Ruthie, you've been dating Tommy for two years and you never looked the way you look when you talk about Jack." Diane squeezes my hand. "That's not crazy. That's real."

Rita appears suddenly, making both of us jump.

"You two planning to work today, or just gossip?"

"Working, Rita!" Diane grabs a coffeepot and flees.

I return to my napkin dispensers, but Rita lingers.

"That motorcycle boy still coming in every day?"

"Yes, Rita."

"And you're still just serving him coffee and pie?"

I meet her eyes. "What else would I be doing?"

She studies me for a long moment. "I don't know, honey. But whatever it is, be careful. Boys like that—they make big promises but they don't stick around when things get hard."

"Maybe you're wrong about him."

"Maybe. But I've been wrong about a lot fewer things than I've been right about." She pats my shoulder. "Just don't go breaking your heart, okay? Or Tommy's."

After Rita leaves, I pull out my journal and write:

*Everyone keeps warning me about Jack. Dangerous. Drifter. Heartbreaker. But none of them know him like I do. They see the motorcycle and the leather jacket. I see the boy who reads Steinbeck and believes in my dreams and is brave enough to stop running.*

*Diane asked if I love him. I think I do. I think I have for weeks. And that's terrifying because loving Jack means choosing uncertainty. Choosing risk. Choosing a future that's not mapped out and guaranteed.*

*But maybe that's the point. Maybe love isn't supposed to be safe.*

Thursday night comes again. Jack is waiting under the streetlight, but this time when I climb on the motorcycle, he doesn't head north on the highway. Instead, he drives to the pier, parks at the far end where no one goes.

We walk out to the end, our footsteps echoing on the wooden planks. The ocean stretches dark and endless below us, and the town glitters behind us, distant and small.

"I need to know something," Jack says without preamble. "Are you ashamed of this? Of us? Is that why we're secret?"

The question wounds like a knife. "No. Jack, no. I'm not ashamed."

"Then why? Why can't we just be together openly?"

"Because my parents would forbid it. Because Tommy would be hurt. Because this whole town would judge me and gossip and make it impossible." I lean on the railing. "I know it's not fair to you, keeping you hidden. But I'm not ready for the fallout yet."

"When will you be ready?"

"I don't know." Tears prick my eyes. "After I talk to Tommy. After I apply to college. After—I don't know."

Jack is quiet for a long moment. Then: "I'm not asking you to choose me over your dreams, Ruthie. I'd never ask that. But I need to know if there's a future here. If this is going somewhere or if we're just killing time until you leave."

"Is that what you think? That I'm just killing time?"

"I don't know what to think. We've been doing this for six weeks—these perfect Thursday nights, these secret conversations. But what happens when you go to San Francisco? When you start your real life? Do I fit into that, or am I just a summer romance you'll look back on fondly?"

The hurt in his voice breaks my heart.

"You're not a summer romance," I say fiercely. "Jack, you're the person who made me believe I could have a real life. Who encouraged my dreams when everyone else dismissed them. Who sees me and doesn't ask me to be smaller or different or more convenient."

"Then prove it. Apply to college. Tell Tommy. Stop hiding."

"I will. I promise. I just need a little more time."

"How much time?"

"I don't know."

He turns away, grips the railing, shoulders tight with frustration. "I can't keep being your secret, Ruthie. It's killing me. Every day I come into that diner and pretend you're just the waitress, pretend I don't know how you look when you're watching the ocean, pretend I'm not completely in love with you—"

He stops. The words hang in the air between us.

"You love me?" My voice is barely a whisper.

Jack turns back, and his eyes are fierce and vulnerable all at once. "Of course I love you. How could I not? You're—" He makes a frustrated gesture. "You're everything. You're kind and smart and brave even when you don't feel like it. You see people clearly and document their stories like they matter. You dream big and work hard and you made me want to stop running and start building something real."

Tears are streaming down my face now. "I love you too."

"Then stop hiding me. Stop hiding us."

"I will. I promise. Just give me until the end of summer. I'll tell Tommy. I'll apply to college. I'll deal with my parents. Just—please. A little more time."

Jack pulls me into his arms, and I bury my face in his chest, breathing in the smell of leather and ocean and him.

"End of summer," he says into my hair. "That's two weeks, Ruthie. After that, I need to know where we stand."

"Okay. Two weeks."

We hold each other on the pier while the ocean crashes below and the stars wheel overhead, and I make a silent promise to myself: I will be brave enough to choose this. Choose him. Choose myself.

Even if it costs me everything.
