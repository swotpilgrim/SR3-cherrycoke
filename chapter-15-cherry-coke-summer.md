# Chapter 15: Journalism Dreams Encouraged

The Wednesday morning rush was winding down. I was wiping the counter when Mr. Henderson cleared his throat in that way that meant he had something important to say.

"Miss Davis," he said, folding his newspaper. "A word?"

Rita waved me off with a knowing look. I slid onto the stool next to him, suddenly nervous.

"I want to talk about your future, Ruthie." His eyes, sharp and kind behind his glasses, studied me. "Have you applied to any colleges yet?"

The directness of the question caught me off-guard. "I... no. Not yet."

"Why not?"

"I'm afraid," I admitted. "Of failing. Of my parents' disappointment. Of leaving everything I know. Of finding out I'm not as good as I think I am."

"That's a smarter fear than most people have." Mr. Henderson tapped the counter. "You know what most people are really afraid of? Finding out they're exactly as good as they think they are. Because then they have no excuse not to try." He leaned forward. "You have real talent, Ruthie. I've read your journal entries. You observe people with clarity and compassion. That can't be taught—either you have the eye or you don't. You have it."

My throat tightened. "Thank you. That means a lot, coming from you."

"I'm not saying it to be kind. I'm saying it because it's true." Mr. Henderson pulled a folded piece of paper from his shirt pocket. "I took the liberty of writing down some schools you should consider. Berkeley has an excellent journalism program. UCLA, Stanford if you want to aim high. San Francisco State is more affordable but still strong. The application deadlines for fall admission have passed, but you could aim for spring semester or next fall."

I stared at the paper in his weathered hand, not quite reaching for it. That list represented everything I wanted and everything I was terrified to want.

"Mr. Henderson, I appreciate this, but I don't know if I can—"

"Yes, you can." His voice was firm now, the editor coming through. "The only question is whether you will. And that's entirely up to you."

"It's not just up to me. My parents—"

He pressed the paper into my hand. "I'll write you letters of recommendation. I still have connections at journalism schools. If you need someone to talk to your parents, I'll do that too."

I looked at the list. Berkeley. UCLA. Stanford. San Francisco State. Each name felt like a door opening.

"Why are you doing this?"

Mr. Henderson smiled, a little sad. "Forty years ago, a waitress told me to apply to journalism school instead of taking over my father's hardware store. She saw something in me I didn't see. Now I'm returning the favor." He stood, leaving money for his bill. "Don't let fear make your decisions, Ruthie."

After he left, I sat at the counter for a long moment, staring at the list of schools. The morning sun streaming through the diner windows made the paper almost glow in my hands.

"He's right, you know." Rita appeared beside me, coffee pot in hand. "About you being talented. I've been watching you scribble in that journal for three years. You see people. That's a gift."

I looked up at her, surprised. Rita had given me nothing but warnings and disapproving looks lately.

"I still think you're being foolish about that motorcycle boy," Rita continued, reading my expression. "But I'm not saying don't go to college. Go. Get out of this town. See the world. Come back if you want to, or don't. But don't stay just because staying is easy."

"Is that what you did?" I asked quietly. "Stayed because it was easy?"

Rita's smile was rueful. "I stayed because I fell in love with a fisherman who loved Seaside Heights more than he loved anywhere else. We had forty good years before he died. I don't regret staying. But I chose to stay, Ruthie. That's different from never leaving because you're scared to try."

She patted my shoulder and moved off to refill other cups, leaving me alone with my thoughts and Mr. Henderson's list.

That evening, I met Jack at the beach as the sun was setting. We'd been varying our meeting spots to avoid gossip. Tonight it was a quiet stretch of sand north of town.

Jack was skipping stones when I arrived. He turned at my footsteps, smiling.

"Hey," he said.

"Hey." I settled beside him, pulling the paper from my pocket. "I need to tell you something."

"Mr. Henderson talked to me today. About college." I handed him the paper. "He thinks I should apply. He offered to help with recommendations and everything."

Jack unfolded the paper, studying the list of schools. Something flickered across his face—pride mixed with something that looked like pain.

"These are great schools," he said quietly.

"They're in San Francisco. Berkeley. Los Angeles."

"I know where they are." Jack was still looking at the paper, not at me. "This is what you want, right? What you've been dreaming about?"

"Yes," I admitted. "But—"

"Then you should do it." He looked up at me finally, and his expression was fierce with conviction. "You should apply to all of them. You should go."

"Jack, we haven't really talked about what that means. For us."

"It means you chase your dreams." He handed the paper back carefully. "It means you don't let anything hold you back. Including me."

"You're not holding me back."

"Not yet. But I could." Jack's voice was rough. "If you stay in Seaside Heights because of me, if you don't apply because you're worried about leaving me behind—that's exactly what holding you back looks like. And I won't do that to you."

I turned to face him fully. "What if I want you to be part of my future?"

"Then I'll figure out how to be part of it. But your future shouldn't depend on me, Ruthie. It should depend on you and what you want." He touched my face gently. "Apply to the schools. Write the essays. Go to the interviews. When you get accepted—and you will get accepted—you go. You don't look back and you don't feel guilty."

"Just like that?" My voice cracked. "I just leave and we... what? Write letters and hope?"

"Maybe. I don't know." Jack's honesty was painful and beautiful. "I've never done this before, remember? I don't know how to be someone's person while they're building a life somewhere else. But I know I don't want to be the reason you don't build that life at all."

Tears stung my eyes. "I don't want to lose you."

"You're not losing me. You're going toward something bigger than Seaside Heights. Bigger than us, maybe." He pulled me close, his chin resting on top of my head. "Your dreams matter more than my fear of being left. Do you understand? They matter more."

"What about your dreams?" I asked. "Don't they matter too?"

"My dream right now is staying in one place and learning to trust that good things can last. I can do that here." Jack's arms tightened around me. "And maybe, if I prove I can stay put, if I build something real here—maybe you'll come back sometimes. Between semesters. During breaks. Maybe we figure out how to do this long-distance thing."

"Maybe isn't very certain."

"No," he agreed. "But it's more than I've ever had before. And it's more than nothing."

We sat in the sand as the sun melted into the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink and purple.

"I'm scared," I whispered.

"Me too," Jack said. "But maybe being scared means it matters enough to be worth it."

"When did you get so wise?"

"Since I met a girl who saw past my leather jacket." His smile was gentle. "Apply to the colleges, Ruthie. Be brave enough to want what you want."

"And you'll be here? You'll stay?"

"I'll stay," Jack promised. "I'll be here in Seaside Heights, working at Murphy's, learning how to put down roots. And when you come back to visit, I'll still be here. That's my promise to you."

"What if I can't come back often? What if school keeps me too busy?"

"Then we write letters. Long ones." Jack brushed a strand of hair from my face. "And we tell each other the truth in those letters. If it gets too hard, if one of us meets someone else, if it stops working—we're honest about it. No disappearing. No silent goodbyes."

The specificness of that last part hurt—I understood why. He needed the promise of honest endings because he'd never gotten that from his mother.

"No disappearing," I promised. "No silent goodbyes. If it ends, we say it out loud."

"Deal."

We sealed it with a kiss, soft and sad and full of hope all at once. When we pulled apart, the sun had fully set, leaving the first stars visible in the deepening blue.

"I should get you home," Jack said reluctantly.

"Not yet. Stay a little longer."

So we stayed, sitting in the sand with his arm around me and my head on his shoulder, both of us looking at the future we couldn't quite see but were brave enough to reach for anyway.

When Jack finally dropped me off at the end of my street, I clutched Mr. Henderson's list in my hand like a promise. Tomorrow I'd start researching application requirements. Tomorrow I'd begin the scary, exhilarating process of reaching for more.

But tonight, I let myself feel the bittersweet truth: sometimes getting what you want means accepting that it won't look like you imagined. Sometimes love means encouraging someone to grow even when that growth takes them away from you.

And sometimes the bravest thing you can do is want something anyway, even when you can't see how all the pieces will fit together.

I walked home slowly, the college list in my pocket and Jack's promise in my heart.

For the first time in a long time, the future felt less like a trap and more like a vast, terrifying, beautiful expanse of possibility.

And I was ready to step into it.
