# Chapter 13: Diane's Warning

The Sunday lunch crowd had finally cleared, leaving only Mr. Henderson nursing his third cup of coffee at the counter and a couple of tourists studying a map by the window. I was refilling salt shakers in the back room when Diane cornered me, her expression serious in a way that made my stomach clench.

"We need to talk," she said, closing the door behind her.

I set down the salt container. "About what?"

"Don't play dumb, Ruthie. You know exactly what." Diane crossed her arms, her usual brightness dimmed by worry. "The whole town is talking about you and that motorcycle boy."

My defenses went up immediately. "His name is Jack."

"I know his name. Everyone knows his name now." Diane leaned against the storage shelf, her voice dropping lower. "Mrs. Patterson saw you with him on the pier Thursday night. She told my mother at church this morning, who of course immediately told me. And if she told us, she's told everyone else."

I felt heat rise to my cheeks. "We were just talking."

"At midnight? On the pier? Ruthie, come on." Diane's eyes were pleading. "I thought it was romantic at first, I really did. Like something from a movie. But it's gotten serious, and people are starting to notice."

"So what if they notice?" I said, more defensively than I intended. "We're not doing anything wrong."

"It doesn't matter if you're doing anything wrong!" Diane's voice rose, then dropped again quickly. "What matters is what people think. And what they think is that sweet Ruthie Davis is sneaking around with a dangerous drifter behind her boyfriend's back."

"He's not dangerous. And Tommy's not my boyfriend anymore."

Diane's eyes widened. "What? When did that happen?"

"Last night. We broke up."

"Oh, Ruthie." Diane sank down onto an overturned crate, looking genuinely distressed. "Was it because of Jack?"

"It was because of me," I said firmly. "Because Tommy wanted me to marry him and live in that house on Maple Street and never want anything more than Seaside Heights has to offer. I couldn't do it, Diane. I couldn't say yes to a life that felt like suffocating."

"But Tommy's a good guy. He loves you. He has a steady job, a future—"

"A future I don't want!" The words came out sharper than I intended. "Why is that so hard for everyone to understand? Just because it's a good future for someone doesn't mean it's the right future for me."

Diane was quiet for a moment, processing. "So you broke up with Tommy... for Jack?"

"I broke up with Tommy because I was lying to him and to myself. Jack just helped me see it."

"And what exactly is Jack offering you?" Diane asked gently. "Has he talked about staying? About the future? Or is he just... here?"

The question hit uncomfortably close to the truth. "We're figuring things out."

"Ruthie, I love you. You know I do. But I'm scared for you." Diane reached for my hand. "This isn't just about romance or following your heart or whatever. This is about your reputation. Do you know what people are saying?"

"I can imagine."

"No, I don't think you can." Diane's grip tightened. "They're saying you've changed. That you're not the good girl everyone thought you were. That you threw away a perfectly good boy for some nobody who'll break your heart and leave town. And the way things work around here—for girls, especially—that kind of talk doesn't just go away."

I pulled my hand back. "So I'm supposed to care more about what people say than about what I want?"

"I'm saying you need to think about consequences. This is 1957, Ruthie. Girls who get reputations don't get them back. It doesn't matter if it's fair or if you didn't do anything really wrong. What matters is what people believe."

"Then people are idiots."

"Maybe they are. But they're also your neighbors, your parents' customers, the people you'll have to face every day. And if you're planning to leave for college, you'll need their support. Recommendation letters. Your parents' willingness to help with tuition. You think they'll be willing to do that if they think you've thrown your life away for some boy?"

The practical angle caught me off guard. I hadn't thought that far ahead.

Diane saw my hesitation and pressed on. "And what about Jack himself? Do you really know him? Where he's from, where he's going? What if he leaves tomorrow?"

"He won't," I said, but there was less certainty in my voice than I wanted.

"How do you know?" Diane wasn't being cruel; her worry was genuine. "Ruthie, I'm not saying he's a bad person. I'm saying he's an unknown person. He showed up out of nowhere on a motorcycle, and he could leave the same way. Meanwhile, you're burning bridges with Tommy, with your parents, with the whole town—for what? For somebody who might not even be here next month?"

"You don't understand him," I said quietly. "Nobody does. They just see the leather jacket and the motorcycle and they assume—"

"I'm sure he's very misunderstood and deep and all of that," Diane interrupted. "But that doesn't change reality. In Seaside Heights, appearance is reality. If you look like trouble, you are trouble. If you're seen with trouble, you become trouble too."

"That's not fair."

"Of course it's not fair! But it's true." Diane stood up, her expression softening. "Look, I'm not trying to be mean. I'm trying to be your friend. The kind of friend who tells you the truth even when it's uncomfortable."

"The truth is that everyone's judging without knowing anything real," I said.

"Then help me understand." Diane's voice gentled. "What's so special about Jack Malone that you're willing to risk everything?"

How could I explain it? The way Jack saw me—really saw me—in a way no one else ever had? The conversations that lasted hours because we both had so much to say? The feeling that with him, I could be myself instead of performing the role of Good Daughter, Good Girlfriend, Good Girl?

"He makes me feel like myself," I said finally. "With everyone else, I'm who they expect me to be. With Jack, I can just... be."

Diane's expression softened further. "I get that. I do. But Ruthie, you can't build a future on feelings. What happens when the summer ends? When reality sets in? What's the actual plan here?"

"I don't know," I admitted. "I'm applying to colleges. Jack might stay in Seaside Heights. We'll figure it out."

"So you'll be apart."

"Eventually. Maybe. But that doesn't make what we have now less real."

Diane sighed, a long exhale that sounded like defeat. "You're really not going to listen to me, are you?"

"I am listening. I just don't agree."

"Your parents know about him?"

"They know there's someone. They're not happy about it."

"Of course they're not." Diane shook her head. "Ruthie, I want you to be happy. I want you to follow your dreams and go to college and become a famous writer. But I also don't want to watch you crash and burn. And from where I'm standing, that's exactly what's about to happen."

"Or maybe I'll be fine," I said quietly. "Maybe choosing what I want instead of what everyone expects will actually be the thing that saves me."

"From what?"

"From becoming someone I don't recognize." The words came from somewhere deep and true. "From waking up at thirty-five in that house on Maple Street wondering what happened to the girl who wanted more."

Diane looked at me for a long moment, and I saw understanding flicker across her face, mixed with something like sadness. "You really would rather risk everything than settle, wouldn't you?"

"Yes."

"Even if it means Jack leaves? Even if college doesn't work out? Even if you end up alone?"

I thought about it, really thought about it. "Even then. Because at least I'll know I tried. I'll know I chose myself."

Diane stood and pulled me into a hug. "You're either really brave or really stupid, and I honestly can't tell which."

"Maybe both," I said, hugging her back, grateful that even in disagreement, she was still here.

"Just promise me one thing," Diane said, pulling back to look at me. "Promise me you'll be careful. Not just with Jack, but with everything. Your heart, your reputation, your future. All of it."

"I promise to try."

"That's the best I'm going to get, isn't it?"

"Probably."

Diane shook her head, but she was almost smiling. "You're going to give me gray hair before I'm twenty."

"Sorry."

"No, you're not." She headed for the door, then paused. "For what it's worth, I hope I'm wrong. I hope Jack is everything you think he is, and I hope it all works out perfectly."

"But you don't think it will."

"I think the world is harder on girls who color outside the lines." Diane's smile was sad. "But maybe you're strong enough to handle it. I guess we'll find out."

After she left, I stood in the back room surrounded by supplies and the lingering smell of grease and coffee, my stomach churning with anxiety. Diane was my best friend, and she was worried for good reasons. The town was talking. My reputation was suffering. I'd broken up with Tommy, upset my parents, and tied myself to someone who might leave.

But even knowing all that, even feeling the weight of all those consequences, I couldn't make myself regret it.

I pulled out my journal and wrote one line: "Sometimes the safe choice is the most dangerous one of all."

Then I went back to the counter, where Mr. Henderson was waiting for a refill and Rita was watching me with knowing eyes. The afternoon shift stretched ahead of me, full of whispers and sidelong glances from customers who'd heard the gossip.

Let them talk. Let them judge. I was done living for their approval.

I was finally living for mine.
