# Chapter 6: First Real Conversation

The Friday lunch rush is brutal. A tour bus disgorges forty seniors, every booth fills, the line extends out the door. Rita shouts orders, Diane's near tears, and I'm juggling eight orders while Mrs. Patterson complains about her eggs.

The coffee pot slips from my hand and crashes to the floor.

Glass shatters across the black-and-white tiles, hot coffee spreading in a dark puddle. The diner goes quiet for one terrible moment, everyone staring at the mess, at me standing in the middle of it with shaking hands.

"I'm so sorry," I gasp, already bending to pick up the pieces. "I'll clean it up, I'll—"

"Ruthie." Jack's voice, calm and steady, cuts through my panic. "Stop."

I look up. He's sitting at his usual counter spot—2:30 is still an hour away, but somehow he's here—and his dark eyes are locked on mine.

"Come here," he says quietly.

The diner is watching, but Jack's hand is extended across the counter. I move toward him.

"Give me your order pad," he says.

My hands are shaking so badly I can barely pull it from my apron pocket. When I do, I see it's soaked with coffee, the orders bleeding into illegible blue smears.

"Okay," Jack says, still in that same calm voice. "That's just paper. Orders can be re-taken. No one's going to die because you dropped a coffee pot."

"But I—"

"Look at me." He waits until I meet his eyes. "Take a breath. Slow, deep. In through your nose, out through your mouth."

I do it, feeling ridiculous, feeling like everyone is watching us—which they are—but also feeling my racing heart start to slow.

"Another one," Jack says.

I breathe again. The shaking in my hands eases slightly.

"The world didn't end," he says with the faintest hint of a smile. "See?"

Rita swoops in with a mop and dustpan, her expression unreadable. "I've got the glass. Ruthie, go check on table eight. And someone needs to retake booth three's order."

The diner slowly returns to its normal chaos. But I feel steadier now, anchored by Jack's calm presence and the breathing exercises he talked me through.

"Thank you," I mouth to him.

He just nods and returns to the book he apparently brought with him early today.

The rest of the rush passes in a blur. By one-thirty, the tour bus has departed and the diner has emptied to just a handful of regulars. Diane disappears to the back room to fix her makeup. Rita mutters something about inventory and vanishes into the storage closet.

I'm refilling sugar dispensers when Jack finally speaks.

"You handled that well. The recovery, I mean."

"I shattered a coffee pot and nearly burst into tears. That's not handling anything well."

"You kept going. That's what matters." He pauses. "Lunch rushes like that—they happen a lot?"

"Only when the universe hates me." I set down the sugar canister. "What are you even doing here? You never come in before 2:30."

"Wanted to try the lunch special. See what all the fuss is about."

It's obviously a lie, but a kind one. He came early for some reason, and that reason saved me from a complete meltdown.

I should move away, get back to work, follow my parents' order to keep things professional. But the diner is nearly empty and Jack is looking at me with genuine interest, and I'm so tired of pretending.

"The journal you write in," he says, nodding toward the counter where I sometimes keep it during breaks. "What do you write about?"

The question catches me off guard. No one asks about my journal. It's private, mine, the place where I keep the parts of myself that don't fit into the good daughter/dutiful girlfriend/future diner owner mold.

"Observations, mostly. About customers, the town. People."

"You want to be a writer?" It's not judgmental, just curious.

"A journalist, maybe. I don't know. It's probably a stupid dream."

"Why stupid?"

"Because I live in Seaside Heights. I work at my parents' diner. The closest thing to journalism we have here is the weekly gazette that prints church announcements and recipes."

Jack takes a sip of his coffee, considering. "So leave."

Two words. So simple. Like leaving is something people just do.

"It's not that easy."

"Why not?"

"Because—" I falter, trying to articulate something I've never said out loud. "My parents expect me to take over the diner. My boyfriend expects me to marry him and stay here. Everyone has plans for my life, and none of those plans involve me leaving."

"Boyfriend." Jack's voice goes carefully neutral. "The clean-cut guy who comes in sometimes? Letterman jacket?"

"Tommy. We've been together since sophomore year."

"And he knows about your journalism dreams?"

"I've mentioned it. He thinks it's a phase."

Jack makes a sound that might be a laugh or might be disgust. "A phase. Right. Because wanting to do something meaningful with your life is just teenage rebellion."

The bitter understanding in his voice makes me look at him more closely. "You sound like you know something about that."

"About people not taking your dreams seriously? Yeah. I know about that."

We're talking—really talking—and it feels dangerous and thrilling and more real than any conversation I've had in months.

"What do you dream about?" I ask. "Besides riding motorcycles and reading Steinbeck?"

For a moment, I think he won't answer. His jaw tightens, and he looks away, out the window toward the parking lot where his motorcycle sits.

"Right now? I dream about finding a place that feels like I could stay. Somewhere I'm not running from or running toward. Just... somewhere."

The honesty in his voice makes my chest ache.

"Is Seaside Heights that place?"

"Don't know yet." He looks back at me, and something in his expression shifts. "It's got some things going for it, though."

The air between us feels charged, electric. We're just talking, just having a normal conversation, but it doesn't feel normal. It feels significant.

Rita bustles out from the storage closet, arms full of paper napkin boxes, and the moment fractures.

"Ruthie, honey, can you help me restock?"

"In a minute, Rita."

But Rita's sharp eyes have already moved from me to Jack and back again. "Now would be better."

It's a dismissal and a warning rolled into one.

I excuse myself and follow Rita to the supply closet, where she immediately rounds on me.

"That boy out there—the one you're mooning over—your parents know you're getting friendly with him?"

"We were just talking, Rita."

"Mm-hmm. That's how it starts." She shakes her head. "I've seen girls like you fall for boys like him. It never ends well."

"Girls like me?"

"Good girls with their whole lives ahead of them. You're Tommy Richardson's girl. Don't throw that away for a boy on a motorcycle who'll be gone in a week."

"Maybe I don't want that life."

The words hang in the small space, too loud, too honest.

Rita blinks. "What?"

"Maybe I don't want to marry Tommy or take over the diner or live my whole life in Seaside Heights." I can hear my voice rising but I can't stop it. "Maybe I want to go to college and study journalism and see the world outside this town. Did anyone ever think of that?"

Rita's expression softens. "We all want things when we're young. I wanted to be a singer once." She hands me a box of napkins. "But we grow up. We accept reality instead of chasing what's impossible."

"Journalism school isn't impossible. It's just—"

"In San Francisco? Berkeley? Those fancy places that cost more than your parents make in a year?" Rita shakes her head. "Be realistic, Ruthie. You've got a good future right here. Don't ruin it by getting involved with a drifter who reads pretty books and says pretty words."

She leaves me standing in the supply closet, holding napkins and feeling like I've been doused in cold water.

When I return to the main diner, Jack is watching me. I should stay away, heed my parents' warning, Rita's advice. Instead, I pour Jack a fresh cup of coffee and linger at the counter.

"You asked what I write about," I say quietly. "I write about people who feel trapped in lives they didn't choose. People who want more than what they're offered but don't know how to ask for it."

Jack's eyes meet mine. "That sounds like good journalism to me."

"You think so?"

"Writing about people who feel trapped might be the most honest thing you could do. Most people DO feel trapped. They just don't admit it."

He pulls out his book and sets it on the counter: East of Eden.

"There's a part in here," Jack says, flipping through pages like he knows exactly where to find it. "About timshel. It's a Hebrew word. Means 'thou mayest.'"

"Thou mayest what?"

"Anything. Everything. It's about choice—we're not stuck with the lives we're given." He looks up at me. "Steinbeck understood that wanting more isn't selfish. It's human."

Tears prick my eyes. We're talking about a book, but it feels like everything.

"What if choosing differently means disappointing everyone who loves you?"

"Then they don't love you," Jack says simply. "They love the version of you that does what they want."

It's such a stark truth that I have to look away.

Jack finishes his coffee and stands, pulling out his wallet. He leaves his usual oversized tip and the book.

"Wait," I say. "Your book."

"Keep it. Read the timshel part. Chapter fourteen, I think." He meets my eyes. "And Ruthie? Your dreams aren't stupid. Anyone who tells you they are doesn't know what they're talking about."

Then he's gone, the bell jingling behind him, leaving me holding East of Eden and feeling like something fundamental just shifted in my understanding of the world.

I flip to chapter fourteen and find the passage about timshel. About choice. About the possibility that we can choose our own paths instead of following the ones laid out for us.

Diane appears at my elbow. "Did the motorcycle boy just give you a book?"

"Looks like it."

"Ruthie Davis, are you flirting with danger?"

I look at the book in my hands, at the door Jack just walked through, at the life I've been living like it was the only option.

"Maybe," I say. "Maybe I am."

And for the first time in a long time, that doesn't scare me.

It thrills me.
