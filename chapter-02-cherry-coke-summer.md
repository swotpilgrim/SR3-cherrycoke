# Chapter 2: Tommy's Future Plans

Tommy is waiting for me at our usual spot on the beach, right where the boardwalk stairs meet the sand. He's wearing his baseball letterman jacket even though it's too warm for it, the red leather sleeves catching the late afternoon sun. When he sees me, his whole face lights up with that easy, uncomplicated smile that once made my stomach flip and now just makes me feel guilty for reasons I can't quite name.

"There's my girl!" He jogs over and wraps me in a hug that lifts me off my feet. He smells like the hardware store—sawdust and varnish and honest work. "I've been waiting forever. How was your shift?"

"Long." I don't mention Mr. Henderson or journalism or the word I wrote at the top of my journal page. "How was your day?"

His smile somehow gets even brighter. "Ruthie, I have the best news. Come on, let's walk."

He takes my hand and leads me down the beach, away from the crowds of tourists and shrieking children. The sand is still warm from the day's sun, and the ocean stretches out forever, blue and endless and indifferent to the conversation I can feel building.

"So my dad pulled me aside this morning," Tommy says, practically vibrating with excitement. "He's been watching how I handle customers, how I'm learning inventory and ordering. And Ruthie—he's offering me a management position. Starting September, I'll be assistant manager at Richardson Hardware."

"Tommy, that's—" I search for the right word. "That's great. Congratulations."

"It's more than great. It's the start of everything." He squeezes my hand. "I'll be making real money, Ruthie. Enough to start saving for a house, for our future. Dad says in a few years, when he retires, the store will be mine. Ours, I mean. Ours."

The word sits heavy between us. Ours. As if my future ownership of a hardware store is already decided, already signed and sealed.

"And I've been thinking," Tommy continues, oblivious to the tightening in my chest. "There's that new development going up on Sycamore Street, you know? Those little houses with the yards? We could get one of those. Three bedrooms would be perfect—one for us, one for a guest room, and one for when we start a family."

He's painting a picture, bright and detailed and suffocating. I can see it all: the little house on Sycamore Street, close enough to both our parents that they can drop by anytime. Tommy managing the hardware store while I work mornings at the diner. Sunday dinners with both families. The same faces, the same conversations, the same life on an endless loop.

"You've got it all planned out," I say, trying to keep my voice light.

"Not all of it. I mean, I don't know if you want a blue kitchen or a yellow one." He grins like this is charming. "But the important stuff, yeah. I've been thinking about it a lot, Ruthie. About us, about our life together."

We reach the quieter part of the beach, where the tourists thin out and local couples walk hand in hand. Tommy points to a young family—a mother pushing a stroller, a father carrying a toddler on his shoulders.

"That'll be us in a few years," he says softly. "Coming down to the beach on Sunday afternoons, teaching our kids to swim."

My throat feels tight. "Tommy, I've been thinking about college."

He laughs—actually laughs—and pulls me closer. "You and those college dreams. Ruthie, you've been reading too many magazines. You don't need college to be happy."

"But what if I want it? What if I want to study journalism, write for a newspaper—"

"Baby, that's not realistic." His voice is gentle, like he's explaining something obvious to a child. "We live in Seaside Heights. There's no newspaper here except the weekly gazette, and old Mr. Parker's been running that since before we were born. What would you even write about?"

Everything, I want to say. People and stories and the world beyond this town. But the words stick in my throat.

"Besides," Tommy continues, steering us toward the boardwalk, "you're already doing something real. Your parents need you at the diner. And when we have kids, you can still work part-time if you want. Best of both worlds, right? You get to help your family and have time for our family too."

We climb the wooden steps to the boardwalk, the planks warm and weathered under my feet. The smell of cotton candy and popcorn drifts from the vendors, mixing with the salt air. Tommy buys us two ice cream cones from the cart—strawberry for me, chocolate for him, the same order we've had since we were fifteen.

"Look at them," Tommy says, nodding toward an elderly couple sitting on a bench, sharing a bag of peanuts. "Married for probably fifty years. That's what I want, Ruthie. That kind of forever."

I watch the old couple, their comfortable silence, the way they move in practiced synchronization. They probably have the same conversations every day, eat dinner at the same time, follow the same routines. Maybe they're happy. Maybe routine becomes comfort after enough years.

Or maybe the woman once dreamed of being somewhere else, doing something different, and learned to stop dreaming.

"My mom said something interesting yesterday," Tommy says, licking his ice cream. "She said she saw a ring at Jenkins Jewelers that she thinks you'd love. Silver band with a small diamond. Simple, classic. I was thinking maybe I could start saving for it. Nothing official yet, but you know, start planning."

The ice cream turns to dust in my mouth. A ring. He's thinking about engagement rings while I'm thinking about college applications.

"Tommy, we're only seventeen."

"Almost eighteen. And lots of couples our age are getting engaged. The Hendersons' daughter got married at nineteen. Diane says she wants to be married by twenty." He looks at me with such open, honest affection that I feel like the world's worst person. "I know we're young, Ruthie. I'm not saying tomorrow. But soon. When we know, we know. Right?"

"Right," I echo, but the word tastes like a lie.

We walk the length of the boardwalk, Tommy pointing out other young couples, talking about the beach bonfire next weekend, mentioning that his cousin's band might play. He talks about expanding the hardware store's tool section, about the new ranch houses being built on the edge of town, about everything and nothing.

I eat my ice cream and nod and try to remember when Tommy's plans started feeling like a cage instead of a promise.

"You're quiet today," he says finally, as we loop back toward my house. "Everything okay?"

"Just tired from work."

"You work too hard. Once we're married, you won't have to work those long shifts. I'll take care of you."

There it is again. That assumption that I want to be taken care of, that my job is something to escape from rather than something I might want to build on. Tommy sees the diner as a burden I'll be relieved to give up. He can't imagine that I might want to write about places like Pop's, document the people and stories that pass through.

We reach my front porch as the sun starts to sink toward the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink. Tommy pulls me close, his arms around my waist, and kisses me. His lips are familiar, practiced, sweet with chocolate ice cream.

Once upon a time, Tommy's kisses made me dizzy. Now I feel like I'm kissing my brother, or a very nice stranger, or a future I don't want.

He pulls back, smiling. "I'll see you tomorrow? Maybe we can catch a movie."

"Maybe." I force a smile. "I'll have to check my schedule."

"Okay. I love you, Ruthie."

The words hang in the air between us, waiting for my automatic response. I love you too. It's what I always say. It's what he expects.

"Goodnight, Tommy," I say instead.

If he notices the omission, he doesn't show it. He jogs down the porch steps, turning to wave before he heads toward his house three blocks over.

I stand on the porch and watch him go, this boy who loves me, who wants to give me a life he thinks is perfect. Tommy Richardson with his hardware store future and his three-bedroom house and his simple, certain plans.

He never asked what I wanted. He just assumed I wanted what he wanted, that his dreams were big enough for both of us.

In the distance, I hear the ocean, endless and indifferent. Beyond Seaside Heights, beyond this porch and this street and this entire town, there's a world I've only seen in newspapers and magazines. San Francisco with its hills and newspapers and journalism school. Cities where people write about important things and ask questions and don't spend their whole lives in one place.

I pull my journal from my purse and add a new line under "San Francisco State University—Journalism Program."

*Question: Is it selfish to want more than what you're offered?*

I don't write down the answer, because I don't know it yet. But standing on my porch, watching the sky darken and the first stars appear, I feel the walls of my life pressing in.

Tommy's plans don't include my dreams. They don't even acknowledge that I have dreams separate from his.

And somewhere deep inside, in a place I'm afraid to examine too closely, I know that no amount of ice cream cones and sweet kisses can fix that.

Inside the house, I can hear my mother setting the table for dinner. The screen door bangs shut behind me as I go in, leaving the wide ocean and the wider world outside.

For now.
