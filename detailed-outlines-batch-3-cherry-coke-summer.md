        Ruthie returns to her bedroom, completely alone. She has lost Tommy, her parents' approval, the town's respect, and now Jack.

        She spirals, wondering if everyone (her parents, Tommy, Diane) was right and she was just a fool.

        Even in her misery, she knows she couldn't have said yes to Tommy. That would have been a slow suffocation of her true self.

        She pulls out her journal and writes through the night, processing her pain and her choices.

        Jack admits he's never had anyone want to keep him; his mother and father both left. He's waiting for Ruthie to realize he's not worth it.
