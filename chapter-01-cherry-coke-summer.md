# Chapter 1: The Counter Girl's Routine

The chrome edge of the counter catches the early morning light, throwing silver streaks across the black-and-white checkered floor. I run my cloth over it for what must be the thousandth time this summer, erasing invisible smudges that probably aren't even there. The familiar squeak of the vinyl booths, the hum of the refrigerator behind the counter, the tick-tick-tick of the Coca-Cola clock on the wall—it all blends into a soundtrack I know by heart.

Pop's Beach Diner has been my second home since I was fourteen. Now, at seventeen, I could navigate this place blindfolded: twelve red vinyl booths, eight chrome counter stools that spin if you push them just right, one ancient jukebox in the corner that eats quarters and plays Buddy Holly on repeat. The smell of bacon grease and fresh coffee is permanently baked into my uniform, a pale pink dress with white trim that my mother says looks "darling" and I think makes me look about twelve.

I refill the napkin dispensers at each booth, fold the paper napkins into triangular points the way Rita taught me, and try not to think about how I'll be doing this exact same thing tomorrow. And the day after that. And probably every summer until I'm forty, wearing the same pink dress and serving the same Cherry Cokes to tourists who'll forget me before they reach the highway.

The bell above the door jingles, and I paste on my smile before I even turn around.

"Morning, Ruthie!" Mr. Henderson settles into his usual spot at the counter, third stool from the left. He's been coming here every morning since before I was born, orders the same breakfast—two eggs over easy, wheat toast, coffee black—and reads the San Francisco Chronicle with reading glasses perched on his nose.

"Morning, Mr. Henderson." I pour his coffee without asking, the dark stream hitting the white ceramic mug with a familiar splash. "How's the news today?"

"Same as always. Politicians arguing, somewhere in the world there's trouble, and the Giants lost again." He folds the paper and peers at me over his glasses. "You look tired, Ruthie. Your parents working you too hard?"

I think about lying, saying I'm fine, but Mr. Henderson has kind eyes and actually seems to want the truth. "Just another summer," I say instead.

He nods slowly, like I've said something more meaningful than I intended. "Another summer. That doesn't sound particularly enthusiastic."

Before I can answer, the morning rush starts. The bell jingles in a constant rhythm as regulars file in—Mrs. Patterson who always orders grapefruit juice and dry toast, the Morrison twins who work at the hardware store and split a stack of pancakes, old Mr. Chen who runs the tackle shop and drinks four cups of coffee before he says a single word. I fall into the routine: pour coffee, take orders, deliver plates, refill cups, smile, nod, pretend I'm invested in Mrs. Patterson's bunion problems.

Rita shoulders through the kitchen door with two plates balanced on each arm, her gray hair pinned in its usual tight bun. She's worked here since the diner opened, knows every customer by name and probably their life stories too.

"Ruthie, honey, take these to booth six," she says, handing off the plates. "And tell Diane to stop primping in the bathroom and get out here. We're not paying her to practice her lipstick."

I deliver the plates—eggs and bacon for the tourists in booth six who smell like suntan lotion and have sand between their toes—and knock on the bathroom door. Diane emerges in a cloud of hairspray, her blonde ponytail perfect and her own pink uniform somehow looking glamorous instead of childish.

"Rita says—"

"I know, I know." Diane rolls her eyes but she's grinning. "Did you see Billy Martinez come in? He looked right at me, Ruthie. I swear he's going to ask me to the beach bonfire this weekend."

I can't help but smile. Diane has been boy-crazy since the sixth grade, and she treats every summer like it's her personal romantic movie. "Better get out there before Rita has both our heads."

The rush doesn't slow until nearly nine o'clock. By then my feet ache in my white canvas sneakers and I've poured enough coffee to float a ship. My right shoulder has that familiar twinge from carrying heavy plates, and there's a coffee stain on my apron that I'll have to scrub out tonight. I'm wiping down booth three when I hear my parents' voices from the kitchen, that particular tone that means they're Discussing Important Things.

"—expansion would give us room for four more booths—"

"Ben, we'd have to take out a loan—"

"But Ruthie will take over eventually. We need to think long-term—"

My hand freezes mid-wipe. They're talking about me again. Planning my future over the grill like they're planning the lunch special.

I retreat to the counter and pull out my journal from under the register, that worn blue notebook I've been filling since freshman year. Mr. Henderson is still at his spot, now on his second cup of coffee and the sports section.

I flip to a fresh page and start writing, the words coming fast:

*Another summer serving Cherry Cokes. Another year of everyone planning my life like I'm a diner booth they're rearranging. Mom wants me to take more shifts. Dad wants me to learn the books. Tommy wants me to—*

"What are you writing?"

Mr. Henderson's question startles me. I close the journal too quickly, guilty, like I've been caught doing something wrong.

"Nothing. Just... nothing."

He takes off his reading glasses, folds them carefully. "I've been watching you all summer, Ruthie. Every time there's a lull, you pull out that notebook. That's not 'nothing.' That's something."

My face flushes hot. I don't talk about the journal. It's private, mine, the only place where I can say what I really think without someone telling me I'm being impractical or silly or ungrateful.

"I just... I like to write things down sometimes."

"What kind of things?"

I glance toward the kitchen, but my parents are still deep in their expansion discussion. Rita's busy with a new customer at booth seven. Diane's flirting with Billy Martinez by the jukebox.

"Observations," I say quietly. "About people, mostly. The tourists who come through. The regulars. The way Mrs. Patterson always orders grapefruit juice but never actually drinks it. Stuff like that."

Mr. Henderson's eyes light up. "That's journalism, Ruthie."

The word hangs in the air between us, bright and impossible.

"I... I mean, I've thought about it. Journalism school, maybe. There's a program at San Francisco State that—" I stop myself. Why am I telling him this? I haven't even told my parents. I definitely haven't told Tommy.

"San Francisco State has an excellent journalism program," Mr. Henderson says. "I should know. I taught there for fifteen years before I retired."

My jaw actually drops. "You were a journalism professor?"

"Newspaper editor for thirty years before that. San Francisco Chronicle." He taps his folded newspaper like it's proof. "I know journalism when I see it, Ruthie. And that notebook of yours? That's where it starts. Observing. Documenting. Asking questions."

Something warm unfurls in my chest, something dangerous that feels like hope.

"My parents want me to take over the diner," I hear myself say. "Everyone expects me to stay in Seaside Heights, marry Tommy, work here until—" I can't finish the sentence. Until I'm old. Until life has passed me by. Until I wake up one day and realize I never even tried to want something different.

"What do *you* want, Ruthie?"

No one ever asks me that. Not my parents, who assume they know. Not Tommy, who assumes I want what he wants. Not even Diane, who's so caught up in her own summer romances that she can't imagine anyone wanting to leave paradise.

"I want to leave," I whisper. "I want to study journalism and write about real things and see the world outside this town. I want—" I stop, horrified at myself. "That sounds so ungrateful. My parents have given me everything. The diner is—"

"The diner is theirs," Mr. Henderson says gently. "Not yours. Unless you want it to be."

"I don't." The words come out fierce and certain. "I don't want it to be."

He smiles. "Then apply to colleges, Ruthie. San Francisco State, Berkeley, wherever your heart tells you. I'll write you a recommendation letter. I still have connections in the journalism department."

"I couldn't—"

"You could." He pulls out his wallet, leaves a five-dollar bill for his three-dollar breakfast. "You absolutely could. The only question is whether you will."

He leaves, the bell jingling behind him, and I stand there holding my journal against my chest like armor.

Through the plate-glass window, I watch tourists pile into their cars, heading back to their real lives in San Francisco or Los Angeles or wherever they came from. They'll leave Seaside Heights behind like a postcard, a pleasant memory of sun and sand and Cherry Cokes at a cute little diner.

And I'll still be here. Unless.

The word hangs in my mind, fragile and terrifying. Unless.

I open my journal and write across the top of a fresh page in large, definite letters: *San Francisco State University—Journalism Program.*

It feels like drawing a map to somewhere I'll never actually go. But for the first time in a long time, somewhere feels possible.

Rita calls my name—booth four needs refills—and I tuck the journal away. Back to work. Back to Cherry Cokes and vinyl booths and the familiar routine.

But inside, something has shifted. Mr. Henderson called what I do journalism. He offered to help me escape.

I glance at my parents in the kitchen, still planning my future without me. At Diane giggling with Billy Martinez like summer romance is the height of ambition. At the chrome counter I've wiped down a thousand times.

Another summer exactly like the last one.

Unless it isn't.
